    "body": "I poured the Tuscan Whole Vitamin D Milk, Gallon, 128 oz into a reasonably sized bowl, filled about halfway with cheerios. I ate in the dim morning light of my dining room, watching the cheerios dance around the bowl as my spoon captured their brethren, I remembered my Uncle Richard, \"John\", as my mother called him. My father wasn't around much during my childhood (always away on business in Sioux Falls) so Uncle Richard was more a father to me. I remember squirrel hunting near the Black Hills after Thanksgiving, snow gently covering the meadows surrounded by dense forests of ponderosa pine, spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, bur oak, and green ash. He was always a jokester, one of his favorites was about cheerios, but I had long forgotten it. As the Tuscan Whole Vitamin D Milk, Gallon, 128 oz fell into my stomach, I remembered it. I can still see his wide-eyed smile after he told it to me on the bank of the Belle Fourche River.There are three classes of cheerios, the lower class (plain ol' cheerios), the middle class cheerios (frosted), and the elite class (honey nut). One soggy morning in Seattle, a plain cheerio awoke in his single room apartment. He looked out at the still sleepy city, blanketed in a mist of rain. He quickly got dressed and put his shoes on, this would be the day. He stood propped against the bus stop, smoking a cigarette.\"God I have got to stop this habit.\" He thought to himself.Glancing back and forth at the bustle of cheerios, he saw her. She looked about 25, devastatingly gorgeous, and he could smell the honey from where he stood.\"Excuse me ma'am,\" his voice quivered, \"I - I think you might be the most beautiful cheerio I have ever seen.\"She smiled and her otherwise golden brown face grew red.\" This is a long shot, but will you marry me?'She was obviously caught off guard by this, but her red lips formed the word, \"Yes.\"They raced through the morning mist of the city, and arrived at her fathers house. The cheerio bent down in front of her father.\"Sir, I would like to ask for your blessing in marrying your daughter\"\"No! You are a regular cheerio and my daughter needs a high quality honey nut\" he snapped.\"But sir.\"\"No means no damnit!\"\"Sir this is very unrea-\"\"You come back a honey nut and you'll have my blessing, my daughter is not about to marry a low life like you.\"The cheerio sprinted home, tears streaming down his face. He fumbled against the lock and sprawled out on his bed. When he awoke it was early, his sheets had a dark silhouette from his wet jacket. He sat up and lit a cigarette. \"Damn.\" he sighed to himself. Walking in front of his mirror, he noticed something different. His body was frosted! He had become a frosted cheerio! He darted out the door without shoes, reaching the honey nut household in no time at all. He banged on the door, and the beauty's father answered.\"Sir I am a changed cheerio! I'm frosted!\" he exclaimed.Her father had a stern look on his face.\"You think you are any better? The dirt on my boots are worth more than you.\" he hissed.The old honey nut slammed the door on the young frosted. He heard the deadbolt click. The newly frosted cheerio didn't take the same way home.He stood on the edge of a bridge, feeling the cool autumn wind on his sugar coated skin. Was he really going to go through with this? Was it worth it? No he was a frosted cheerio now. He couldn't get the girl, but he was a changed cheerio. He stepped off the edge and walked home silently.He woke up late after the good night's rest. Glancing in the mirror he noticed his new golden brown coat. Without putting a shirt on he dashed out the door. He noticed the carton of cigarettes, and tossed them into the trash.Her father was waiting on the porch, 12 gauge in his lap. He was going to finish this dirtbag.He watched a nice young man on a morning run. He was startled when that same young man came bounding on his porch.\"Sir I am better now. I have changed. PLEASE may I marry your daughter. I love her.\" the new honey nut panted.\"Son, I am a man of my word, you have my blessing.\"The cheerio had never been so happy in his entire life.\"You must have the wedding today.\"The cheerio's mood quickly changed. How was he supposed to arrange a high quality honey nut wedding in a day?\"Sir how am I supposed to do that?\" he squeaked.\"Don't worry, you just handle the refreshments.\"Now, what kind of refreshments are served at cheerio weddings? Milk of course!He grabbed his fianc\u00e9 and dashed to the milk store. 50 gallon drums filled to the brim with milk filled the store. He was going to do it. He would finally get the girl. As he toted a drum to the counter, he smelled a familiar smell. Rotten milk. Every single one of the drums had spoiled.\"What are we going to do? We don't have any milk for the wedding!\" he said to his fianc\u00e9\"Don't worry my love, we can use water instead.\" she cooed.They ran to the water store, but they were sold out. At this point the couple was frantic. It was getting late and they needed to get back for the rehearsal.\"I could really use a smoke.\" the cheerio said.\"Don't you give up on me now!\" she yelled, \"You are a honey nut now, and honey nuts never give up!\"\"What are we going to use, juice?\"\"Brilliant! We will use juice\"They ran down the street. They reached the juice store but the line was out the door.\"We will never make it in time!\" the cheerio said.\"Quick! There is a store that sells punch just a few blocks away.\"As they turned the block they saw it. The front windows glistened in the sun.They opened the door, and thankfully....There was no punch line.",

The condensation on the plastic jug sparkled in the morning sunlight, the drips of which marked my passage across the parched pavement.I entered my pantry and set my jug down removing the safety ring followed by the cap. I was immediately awash in the scent of good old fashioned fresh wholesomeness. I could wait no more! Ignoring my ringing phone, and caller ID loudly announcing it was my Mother, I grabbed a bowl down from the cabinet in one hand and my box of Corn Flakes in the other and filled the bowl with anticipations galore.

I shrugged it off and poured away!I waited but an instant for the liquid white velour to permeate the fibers of the crisp yellow flakes, then dashed a spoon into the center giving the mix a quick little stir. Delicately I scooped up a spoonful of Corn Flakes and Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and slid them past my quivering lips and into my mouth. \"Would this measure up to my building expectations?\", I wondered for the brief interval of a heartbeat until my taste buds registered their unanimous approval.\"By the Gods of Elation!\" I cried aloud, \"From this day forward my breakfasts shall always be divine!\"",

No need for a spoon!I can just pour it out in clumps to this ergonomically designed jug the cheese comes in.2.  Excellent consistency!I could really feel the chunks as they slid through my finger tips into proper globs.3.  It's vintage!Just like fine wine, cheese ages amazingly.  And just like fine wine, you need to sip it in small increments spread out over several weeks.4. It makes you see and hear things you never saw before!My lampshade agrees with me, this stuff really opens one's eyes and ears.  Last week, after eating some, I found a portal in my dresser I never realized was there.  Unfortunately, I couldn't fit into it, and ended up breaking my leg, and the dresser, but now I know that there is most definitely another world outside of our own.Cons1.  It tastes horrible.I mean, what do you expect of cottage cheese?  I was prepared for this when I opened it, but even then I was surprised.  It kinda tasted like I was slowly dying.  I honestly can't tell you why that was the first thought that came into my head.2.  It is basically ipecac the first time you try it.I have to admit, I threw up, a LOT after the first swig of this.  For about 11 hours, actually.  But, during those 11 hours, I got some much needed thinking done about my life, so I guess this counts as a partial pro.3.  For some reason it claims to be \"milk\".I'm guessing the dairy farm is just lazy and just slaps the same label onto all of its products.  Still, it's rather confusing seeing cottage cheese come from a milk jug.Overall, I'd say this is an excellent product, in spite of what the doctor with the horrifying stag beetle face who keeps me on IV tubes says.",

    "body": "It was a frigid Friday evening in February, the wind whistling and whining through the barren willow boughs. I was alone at home, except for the fluffy feline that slumbered curled like a fiddlehead fern in front of the flames in the fireplace. All the while, I was unwavering in excitement. This was the wonderful moment I had waited for - with weeks of planning, and many orders of Tuscan Whole Milk. I had been warming the white ambrosia for hours, filling thermoses, simmering it in pots, even filling a coffee urn with the fabulous bovine nectar. No low-fat or non-fat milk would suffice. No cows from Slovenia, Switzerland nor Senegal would do, it had to be Tuscan Whole Milk.I removed the heating pads that warmed my deep claw footed tub for the past hour and one by one, I poured thermos after thermos of the steaming Tuscan-sourced milk into the tepid tub. The milk foamed and frothed as I poured more and more milk into the tub. Quickly, I removed every article of clothing, and slipped into the sumptuous sultry liquid, feeling it yield for my body whilst enveloping me in its creamy grasp. I luxuriated in the lactic liquid with the knowledge that this nutrient had coursed through udders somewhere in the fields of Tuscany, within sight of the fringes of Firenze. The 3.25 percent milkfat caressed my body, nourished my skin and satiated my soul.Near the end of my nocturnal indulgence, the curious cat leapt up to the edge of the tub. Leaning over the opalescent elixir, he lapped up the liquid with his little tongue. This presented an idea! I reluctantly stepped out of the cooled tub and blotted my body dry - not wanting to wipe off the milky film completely. I grabbed an ivory pitcher from the kitchen and dipped it into the milk, filling it to the brim, and then I placed the pitcher in the refrigerator.That night I slept a deep, luxurious sleep, dreaming of several soft hands massaging my supple body with subtly salted Tuscan butter. I awoke refreshed and revitalized. Later that day, a pleasant plumber popped by to look at my hot water heater. When I offered him coffee, he commented that milk would make him content - warm milk. Feeling provocative, I smiled and removed the ivory pitcher from the fridge and poured some milk into a pan to heat it. I presented it to him in a large mug. He sniffed it, sipped it, slurped it, and savored it, standing in the midst of the small kitchen. His eyes grew large, his face flushed, a grin grew upon his gorgeous countenance. He finished the rest of his mug of milk as quickly as he could without burning his mouth, blowing on the surface to cool it between eager sips. Finally, he arched his back and tilted his head back to get every delectable drop of Tuscan Whole Milk, that same Tuscan Whole Milk that had caressed my body the evening before. He stepped closer to me, so close I could smell the Tuscan Whole Milk on his breath. He whispered, \"Questo \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 magnifico latte che abbia mai avuto.\" I slowly wiped off his milk mustache with one hand, and placed my other hand on his chest, and replied, \"La ringrazio. \u00c8 una parte della Toscana. Si tratta di una parte di me.\"",

It seemed like a great decision at the time, but it just happened to arrive while I was on a ten day Caribbean cruise this past May. Where I live, it is HOT in the spring, many days topping out at 90 to 95 degrees. It must have been sitting out on my porch for at least eight of those ten days, due to it's condition when I returned home. As I stepped out of my limousine, gave my driver a generous tip for the ride home from the airport, and walked up my driveway, a gust of wind brought along a stench so horrid that I was nearly knocked off of my feet. I paused for a moment to gag, while pinching my nose and hyperventilating through my mouth. I believed the sour aroma to be emanating from a dead animal of sorts, and I began to trot as fast as I could in my heels to get into my house to escape the smell. I panicked as I struggled to find the right key to open my door. In my frenzy, I realized that the sour smell of death had gotten much stronger, and I whipped around to see the gallon of Tuscan dairy milk, a filthy film of dust obscuring the label. I had been in such a rush that I had ran right past it without noticing it. It was lying on it's side, the lid discarded about two feet away. Perhaps a raccoon had gotten into it and drank it all. But then, where was the stench coming from? I hesitantly stooped to peek into the bottle. What I saw was a solid white brick with the scratch marks of an animal, most likely a raccoon, that had reached it's furry little arms as far as it could into it to scrape as much milk jello as it could for itself. I screamed in horror and kicked it, and continued to kick it until it was in my neighbor's yard. It was their problem now.",

Where would I find it? And would it satisfy my rarified tastes?For days, weeks, months I wandered like a starved zombie through the streets of my home city greedy for the answers to my questions. I lied, I cheated, I stole, I murdered and was no nearer the truth. Until one day, I was told of a wondrous 'virtual' word called 'teh Internets'. I, after many days of intensive instruction, learned how to launch a 'search' on 'teh internets' and found Tuscan whole milk on Amazon. Yes, Amazon. Which I had previously believed to be a river, was now, as they say, 'online'. And on this online (no doubt virtual) river I found Tuscan whole milk.I ordered some. I did. My hands trembled as I did so, so great was my excitement. Imagine how much greater my excitement was when the product eventually arrived.It arrived. I opened it. I drank it. I was enlightened and immediately achieved a serene oneness with the Universe.",

I was awaiting the sweet kiss of sleepiness, but it continued to elude me.  Then I saw her from a far.  The Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz jug of liquid snooze.As I sat down to contemplate how best to consumer her, she spoke to me.  Her sweet lips kissed mine as I brought her close to me.  We exchanged pleasantries for just a brief moment before we were interlocked in the most orally-gratifying way possible.  Then it happened.My wife walked in and caught us.  My pants were at my waist but felt like they were at my ankles.  Her glistening helical axis screwing me just as I would do later to her.  I dropped everything, including my sweet Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz jug.She hit the floor, spilling her heart all over the floor.  I hurt her badly but did I end her?  No.  Her rugged exterior contained the damage and only her sweet elixir spilled.  I was able to grab hold of her before she emptied completely and before I knew it she was put back together.My wife walked over and took her from me.  I figured the worst would happen.  She would kick her to the curb with the rest of the trashy things we had in the house, but she didn't.  She looked at me deep in my eyes, took my lovely Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz jug in both hands and kissed her passionately - just as I had moments before.\"Is that what you wanted?\" she cried.Without a single word that could come out of my mouth, a thought emerged.  A smile as big as the desert sun came across my face.\"I knew it!\" she exclaimed as she walked to the bedroom, bringing our Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz jug with her.\"Grab the cookies,\" she said.  \"We are going to have some fun.\"About an hour later I was exhausted.  My sweetness had done her job.  Sleep came quickly.  Thank you my lovely Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz jug.I recommend Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz if you need to experience life.  I know I did that night.  I may never see her again as she quickly became soured by our experience and ended up leaving when the city workers came by to take her away.

    "body": "While I was a bit apprehensive about buying an off-label brand of milk, I decided to give it a try.  I was feeling rather daring and rebellious that day...I bought All of my Christmas presents at Amazon that morning, then I parked in the red zone while I dropped my boyfriend off at the store.  I even threw a receipt on the ground in the parking lot!  It was an amazing feeling.  Anyhow, I browsed online and found this milk product.  Very intrigued by the name, as I had always wanted to go to Tuscany, Italy, and thought I'd get a taste of that beautiful, historic country.  When it arrived a full 2 days later, I carefully selected a large glass in which to pour this liquid gold into.  I took a sip, then two, then three... Mmmm, this stuff tasted delicious.  Then the phone rang.  It was my boyfriend, telling me that the lottery numbers matched up completely, including the powerball number, and that he was dumping me so he could travel the world.  I was offended that he wouldn't let me take part in his riches, so I, gulp, actually hung up on him.  Can you believe I did that?!  Then the phone rang again, and it was a telemarketer offering to replace my windows at no charge.  Are you kidding?  I felt like I had won the lottery myself!  I made the appointment and chatted with the gentleman all while sipping the liquid gold.  He said he had to go because he had to make some important phone calls, and it sure sounded busy in his office.  Just then, a research group called and asked if I wanted to take part in a clinical trial regarding a new drug to treat cancer.  They were offering me a $50 gift card and I certainly couldn't turn down the offer.  The side effects were that I could suffer from depression or suicidal ideation, break out in hives, suffer irreversible hearing loss, develop liver cancer, show signs of genital warts, and lastly, develop a dangerous heart arrhythmia.  The likelihood was about 80%, but that 20% chance of Not developing these symptoms, AND that $50 gift card was really enticing.  I took the offer.This was last month, and I have gone through about 6 gallons of Tuscan Milk.  I've had to learn sign language and I depend heavily on email communications, I now have a pacemaker to control the arrhythmia, and the hives are driving me nuts.  However, I was lucky enough not to get liver cancer!  I was ecstatic.  They said that the genital warts could be treated with a new product that they are conducting a clinical trial on, so I'm on the list.  My house looks beautiful with all these new windows, however I have to pay someone to fix all the leaks at the window sills.  I don't mind though, I really got a great deal.  The only problem is that they keep sending me bills for thousands of dollars, and I'm contesting it because I was told it was free.  I'm also contesting the Cirby vacuum company charges because they also said that their vacuum would be free if I allowed them to dump soil on my white carpet and vacuum it off.  It's still stained, but a promise is a promise.I'm telling you, this milk has made some magnificent changes in my life.  I highly recommend it above Lucerne.  And if you hear the attorneys on TV requesting you to call for a class-action suit against Cancerosia, I'm part of that, too.  I should make a few hundred bucks for losing my hearing, developing genital warts, and developing permanent hives!",

Because I got results.When the blonde walked through the door to my office, I could see she was no ordinary dame. Despite the hourglass figure and legs up to her neck, her face was what caught my eye. She was sporting a milk mustache over her full pouty lips. I remembered those lips well. They're the reason why I started keeping napkins in my desk drawer.She carried a jug, but I could see that it was not the only one she had. While I hoped to eventually see the other two, she distracted me by unscrewing the cap from the one in her hand.\"Aren't you happy to see me, Slim?\" she asked. I rolled my chair closer to my desk so she couldn't see just how happy I was. I played it cool.\"Sure, baby,\" I said. \"Been a long time.\"\"I know, Slim,\" she whispered, casting her eyes down to the floor. When she bent over to pick them back up, I could see she had tears in them. I hadn't cleaned in a while. The floor was dusty.\"Have a seat,\" I said, watching her. She moved like a cat, slow and sinuous, and walked past the chair. Coming around my desk, she perched on the edge of it, crossing her legs in a way that gave me a glimpse of what the future held. Because there on her knee, she placed the jug that she had been carrying. I could plainly see the label now, \"Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl. oz.\"Fearing my voice would crack like my resolve, I kept my mouth shut and watched as she poured the life-giving fluid into my glass. It sparkled, almost glowing in the dim 40 watt light of my office, as if it was lit by some internal power source. That's when I knew she was using the jug to transport the uranium ore.\"Well, aren't you going to drink it?\" she asked, looking at me suspiciously. She was a dame. That's what they do. But she didn't intimidate me. Not until I reached for my piece and she started unbuttoning her blouse. Because that's when I saw what she was wearing under it: The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee, its moon bulging in three eye-catching dimensions.I knew right then that this was the gal for me. Tossing the Tuscan Whole Milk back in one gulp, I set my glass down on the desk.\"Pour me another?\" I said. She smiled and nodded.",

    "body": "Connoisseurs of fine milk often ask, \"Why is Tuscan Whole Milk so expensive? Is it the velvety texture, the lightly sweet lactose, the softened hue?\" I just smile, amused by the idea that Tuscan's value is defined by its physical components. The truth is something greater, more ethereal, and immeasurable. More than just letting our cows traipse freely across the grassy meadows. More than just their fibrous organic diet.Tuscan Whole Milk is all about relationships. Specifically, the relationship with the cow.We don't treat our cows as mere objects. We're not the type to hang out in barns after hours, filling our emotional voids with the first over-lipsticked heifer who winks at us. We don't confuse our passion with vulgar hunger. We're not dairy lizards on the prowl, looking for vacuous, weathered Bessies to swap cud and play hide-the-udder with.We take our time. We want to get to know the cow. Its passions, its dreams. Our commonalities.Maybe we'll start with dinner. A candle is lit, Mantovani strings play softly. I enter the stable in Versace overalls and masculine confidence. I have bruschetta with kalamata and roasted red pepper tapenade; she has a clump of orchard grass.We don't need each other's life story. We are two beings who just happened to intersect at the same time - we care about who we are now. There will be a lifetime for us to ask questions of each other. But for now, we consume ourselves in each other's gazes and swim in the light of our connection.We laugh. Oh, how we laugh.After we dissolve in the pleasure of each other's company, after we've talked and mooed about our dreams, our loves, the scars of our past heartbreaks, dark moments when we were tipped over by college pranksters - only then do I level my stare, gather my longing and courage, and ask the question that has hovered over the entire morning. A question that must be asked with grace and poise, cognizant of desire, yet protective of the vulnerability of the secret that passes between us:\"Forgive me if this is too forward, but the stirrings of my heart beat in time to the cocking of the rooster, my pulse quickens with the movement of the tractor, and my intent is well-meant. My gentle bovine, my cherished, hooved friend... may I milk you?\"And then, the moment. I place my stool beside her udder, as if I am laying a ceremonial carpet `neath a queen. I pat her side. It's all right, I'm saying. I'm beside you. Close your eyes, my pet, and dream of Kentucky bluegrass.I start gently, with a mild tug, a touch that says all that words cannot. But it can't be rushed, or forced into speed. I'm not some teenage jackhammer, and she's no automatic fountain. Gentle rolls, knowing caresses, speed and velocity only ramping up as it feels natural. My pace hastens, my heart sets it charges, my voice rises to sing with the celestial chorale.At long last, our forbidden dance reaches its pinnacle, its emotional summit! \"We're almost there!\" I exclaim! \"Love me!\" she... well, I'm pretty sure she's saying \"Love me\" in cowspeak, whatever that is. Then at last, long last, I hear the first drops in the bottom of the bucket. Then a quicker series of drops, then... oh, then! Streams of lactic gold, filling our coffers, gushing towards ecstasy until it nearly spills over the sides!It ends all too quickly, yet it feels complete. I roll over and chew on a hayseed. She stands there. Oh, the volumes of words she says by the stillest of movements. She doesn't have to be outlandish in her actions. She doesn't have to acknowledge anything. She knows. We know.So when people ask me, \"Why is Tuscan Whole Milk so expensive?\", I respond with a shaking head, a raised eyebrow, and return the question to them -\"Have you ever really loved a cow?\"",

After finishing my checkout purchase I giggled at myself for ordering such a simple product, but I was completely wrong this product is far from simple. When I finally received the Tuscan Dairy Milk 128 oz. I felt more awake then ever my body felt rebirth while my eyes settled on the luxurious curves of the container. My fingers trailed over the label, the handle, and then finally finding the red ribbed cap that keeps the beauty contained inside. Like a caged bird needing to be set free, I quickly turn the cap and toss it across the floor. There it is sitting in there ready to take any shape that I desire. But as quick as my happiness and curiosity came it vanished, first I saw the milk slowly vibrating then my table, then my house was completely shaking, we were experiencing an earthquake. I had to make the choice save the milk that was nearing the end of the table or take cover and save myself. I do what not many people would do in this situation but I have a conscience and I couldn't let my Tuscan Dairy Whole Milk 128 oz go to waste and not given a chance to be enjoyed. I throw my self on top of the milk to protect it from the on coming debris from my ceiling caving in. Soon I was laying in a puddle of milk under a pile of debris. I knew I could just wait there for help but I needed to save what was left in my Tuscan Whole Milk container. I began digging up to the surface, I cut myself plenty of times but I wasn't worried about my minor injuries, I only had one thing on my mind and it was to have my salivary glands finally taste what was left of the Tuscan Dairy Whole Milk. I could finally here birds chirping in the distance I'm all most there, I can see a little bit of sunshine through the last of what was on top of me. I pushed myself up and my body and my milk was saved. I knew I was going to lose consciousness soon because of my bleeding wounds I quickly raised the milk to my lips but it was to late I passed out. This is why I find myself here again about to purchase my second Tuscan Dairy Whole Milk 128 oz. Hopefully this time I can experience the sensual Tuscan Dairy Whole Milk.",

It might have been that things hadn't turned out quite how he expected or maybe it was just a hormonal thing, but he wasn't himself. I wanted to change that. We went to our favorite spot in the woods right by his house to talk it out. When we arrived, the first thing I did was pull out a bottle of water: his favorite!You see, Greg had been raised on water. It's an unusual thing, I know, but his mom had encouraged him to drink the stuff right from birth. With every meal, he'd order an ice cold water. As he took his first sip of the smooth, thirst-quenching concoction, I KNEW I would get to see my old friend in his happiest state for the first time in months. I looked up to see those beautiful pearly whites...And I caught nothing but dismay. If water, of all the drinks in the world, couldn't raise his spirits, what could?  There had to be something. I had to find a way.I traveled high and low looking for a solution.Greg and I climbed the Himalayas to seek out the fabled Orange Juice Monks. The tangy goodness they crafted left Greg unmoved.We set sail for the Cove of the Sunken Tea. After days of deep-tea diving, we found our booty. But Greg just shrugged off its bold flavor with a frown.In London, we found a hidden alleyway stacked to the buildings' roofs with Gatorade: all flavors! As Greg filtered them all down his gullet alphabetically, he sunk further and further into his depression.Finally, we returned home, hopeless. When Greg and I parted ways, I tried to distract myself from the problem. I dove headfirst into the internet. After 3 straight days of browsing, an advertisement caught my eye. It was for an obscure vendor called \"Amazon.com.\" As if I had no free will of my own, my hand moved the mouse to the ad and clicked it.A search bar at the top: how quaint. With Greg at the forefront of my mind, I moved my cursor there and typed in \"depression antidotes.\" And what was the first item that came up?Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. My heart jumped and I placed an order to be delivered to Greg's house immediately!I know I don't need to tell those of you who have tried this product, but Greg is the happiest he's ever been. He quit his meaningless job the day after he took his first sip and started his own business the next day. Forbes has him on their list of \"500 Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2015.\"He and his wife are more in love and more sexually active than ever before. They're even expecting their first child in the Spring! I think I know what THAT baby will be drinking.Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz saved my friend's life. 5 stars!",

So imagine my surprise when I discovered Tuscan Whole Milk - thank you Amazon!  I guess it was the packaging that initially drew my attention to it.  Was the jug a gorgeous white or is this product actually that color?  Solving that mystery alone made this purchase a winner.  Spoiler Alert: THIS STUFF IS ACTUALLY WHITE!!!There were no directions on the packaging, so I was a little confused on how to properly use this product.  After searching online for hours I discovered that the red cap on top actually screws off of the jug counter-clockwise (who thinks of these things?) I carefully unsrewed the red cap, but immediately ran into my next quandry; what do I do now? Back to the internet(please Tuscan add some directions to the packaging or at least include a manual of some type).Turns out the cut out on the jug isn't simply decorative, it's actually a handle (great idea guys!).  While you cannot get both hands around the handle, believe me I tried, you can adequately control the jug by using 1 hand.  The jug is quite heavy and the opening fairly wide, so I would not suggest trying to drink directly from the jug, I have 3 velvet vests at the dry cleaners who can attest to this!  So I would recommend transferring the milk from the jug to some type of smaller receptacle.  I went with an empty glass that I was storing in my cabinet, if you don't have one of these check on Amazon under \"housewares\" and you can probably find one.Once transferring the milk to my glass, it was time for the taste test.  I sheepishly raised the glass to my lips and took a baby sip while holding my nose (I had no idea what to expect).  It was glorious!  I proceeded to drink the entire glass.  Long story short, this was a great purchase and I have been telling all of my friends about Tuscan Whole Milk.  It's so good I'm going to try to find other uses for this product other than simply drinking it.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated guys!Please be on the lookout for my video review of Tuscan Whole Milk.

I am happy to say it suited me quite well, and I ended up drinking the whole gallon by the end of the day, finishing up with a nightcap of warm milk before bed.  I drifted off to sleep with a full belly, warmth in my heart, and a smile on my face as my last waking thoughts were of the deliciousness of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fluid oz., both cold and heated.Alas, my waking smiles turned to sleeping dread.  It seemed as if I entered dream state the moment my head hit the pillow and my bedside lamp was off.  Suddenly I was in a field in Italy, and a local farmer was yelling at me, \"Che cosa hai fatto? Che cosa hai fatto?  Che cosa faranno adesso?\"  Even though I do not speak Tuscan, somehow I knew he was saying, \"What have you done? What have you done?  What will they do now?\"He motioned for me to come closer, and as I did a giant barn shaped building rose from the ground.  It looked to me to be the size of Rhode Island.  I could hear distant bleats and snorts as well as hooves pawing the ground.  The farmer opened the massive door and beckoned me inside.I could not believe what I saw.  Thousands, no MILLIONS of calves, in various stages of starvation, looked up as the old farmer pointed to me.  \"Egli \u00e8 l'unico!\" he cried to the restless crowd.  \"He's the one!\"The calves as one unit turned to me, their baleful bleats roaring like thunder in my ears.  They did not attack, did not stampede, simply looked at me with their huge brown eyes as if to ask, \"How could you?  How could you take our only food from us?\"Then a single calf, malnourished to the point its skin looked like a mere blanket covering its skeleton, feebly walked up to me.  Its huge eyes stared into mine, and I bent down to face it.  It gave one sorrowful bleat, a bleat that pierced my heart and shattered it into a thousand pieces, then it lay down at my feet and died.Sobbing profusely I picked the calf up, cradled it in my arms and thought, why?  Why had I ordered Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fluid oz.?  I had soda, water, beer, coffee and various teas at home.  Why had I been so selfish as to order what these calves clearly needed to live?Suddenly, the old farmer shut the door.  One by one, the calves started advancing on me.

Sick and tired of our weekly milk dilemma, I decided to go online for help.

Someone has finally made milk in a package large enough to meet my family's special needs.When the package arrived, I thought it looked a little small for 1 gallon and 128 fluid ounces. When I opened it up, I was dismayed to find a container that appeared to be the exact same size as our normal gallon jugs of milk. I held it up to an empty carton and sure enough, it matched in size. Next, I began serving glasses of milk for my children, pouring the contents of the jug out into my measuring cup before transferring it into glasses. I ran a tally of the ounces served, until all my children's bellies were full on milk, and would you look at that! It only added up to 128 fl oz. Hello? Where is the gallon part?! A whole gallon is missing and what's even stranger is that the 128 fl oz part looks exactly the same as a gallon, but the gallon is nowhere to be found.I am trying to return the empty jug for a refund, but the company won't get back to me. 1-star for an inferior product and zero customer service.",

His whole body was greasy, I wanted to touch his hair. He looked and smelled like he hadn't showered for a month or more.

I then asked him how are you this hot. He wouldn't tell me. I proceeded to bombard him with questions. He told me he was a magician. I wanted him so bad. The bar was empty after abut 5 minutes of him entering the bar, so i had him all to myself. The whole bar smelled like him, it was wonderful! I continued asking him questions like how old are you, etc. He told me he was 49. I\u2019m only 22 but I wasn't going to let that get between us. I was having so much fun with him. I asked him how are you this hot again. He then started to pull something out of his bag. It was a gallon of milk. He placed it on the bar counter and said Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon 128 fl.oz. My heart started pounding in my chest more than ever. I asked him to marry me, he said no. He started walking out of the bar. I yelled please tell me  your name. He yelled back Gorbie.

She was the greatest.We rode our bikes (me on my awesome pink trike with glitter streamers out the handles and a squeaky horn. It was pimped out with beads on the spokes and a matching pink glittery unicorn helmet). We met up with her friend, a sophomore named Mike. Mike led us to the other end of town, into a dark alley. I'll never forget the sight of it. Curious items and trinkets littered the area. On a pedestal, we saw it: Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz. It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, besides Nick Carter.We asked to buy the milk, but the guy refused, telling us to get lost. Mike continued insisting, until the guy pulled a gun on us. I hid in my pig tails and nervously bit down on my retainer. \"Let's just go, guys\", I squeaked. Mike scoffed, stating his parents were gone for the weekend and him and Bethany were going to drink the whole gallon, to seal their fate as soulmates.Mike lunged for the gun, prompting Bethany to grab the milk and run. She grabbed it and ran, me sitting on a moldy pizza box, stupefied. A gunshot echoed throughout the alleyway. Mike fell to the ground. Next I heard another shot and Bethany's groan. Trembling, I ran to her. The guy ran the opposite way, upon hearing sirens. I held Bethany in my arms, crying. \"Take.... The Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz\", she stammered.Before I could say, \"heckdoodly with that dingdang milk!\", it jumped from her arms and bit me, before scurrying up the alley's wall!I've since gained special abilities.

My half-witted brother would utter shrill peeps of excitement and rise as far as his chains would permit before I yanked him back down on his bench so I could claim my share.  Well do I remember his moans of envy and Mother's rasping chortle as I slurped deeply of the creamy white nectar, redolent of Swiss meadows, tinkling cow bells and bosomy dirndl-clad milk maids named Inga.When I asked Mother why our milk was so good, she would smile her gap-toothed grin and point to the nuclear power plant that towered over our little farm.  The milk had a curious tingly buzz and faint whiff of ozone that Mother said was ionizing radiation.  It would keep for months without refrigeration.So when I saw Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz on Amazon, I couldn't resist.  I ordered a tin of uranium ore from Amazon along with it.

Just get set up in the Costco parking lot, blast some Skynyrd, and pound some cold 2% on a hot day. You can bet people got jealous when they saw us in action.Over time, this milk-drinking thing became a real competition. Mark Polzack was the best of the bunch - the fastest milk-drinker north of 76th Street. He could take down anything from a half-pint to a quart without blinking. They didn't call him \"Milky Mark\" for no reason. He was always bragging about how he scored high quality milks from Lon's Grocery, and soon we all started doing the same. We went from 2% to 4% to the organic whole milks! Couldn't beat the rush of that white stuff pumping through my veins and dribbling down my chin!Have you ever taken down a speedball? That's when you mix whole milk with buttermilk and chug it.  Really gets you going, but it can lead to some real benders. \"Dairy Dan\" McKinley even wound up in the ER after a 3-day buttermilk rager! I stuck to the whole milks after that. Problem is, I built up a huge tolerance to milk and kept looking for something stronger and purer. Most milk producers cut their product with fillers and chemicals to get a cheap, addictive product on the streets. You're lucky to get milk that's even 80% Holstein anymore. The standard milks, even from Lon's, weren't doing the job. I needed something MORE.So I sprung $45 for 128 fl oz of the Tuscan Whole Milk. It's imported from Tuscany so the dirty U.S. milk grocers don't have a chance to meddle with it. What you're getting here is the real deal. It arrived in a timely manner, with discreet packaging that didn't tip the Feds off. I drew the shades, put on some Skynyrd, and slowly slipped my first glass. Instantly, I became gripped with euphoria - my heart raced and my stomach tingled. I saw stars, and had magnificent visions of spotted cows prancing through violet fields. This milk had to be at least 98% Holstein - it was that strong. I damn near drank half the jug and saved the rest for the next night's milk party.When Milky Mark and Dairy Dan saw what I had, they couldn't believe it. Their eyes were as wide as saucers (of milk). They couldn't believe I got such a bargain on this gallon of milk! Once they got their first hits of Tuscan Whole Milk, they were hooked. This milk provided the perfect rush, without the jitteriness and stomach-upset of store-bought milks. Now it is all we order, and nobody else is the wiser. Our rival milk gang at the Safeway parking lot is going nuts trying to figure out where we get our stuff. Your loss, suckers!To everybody else, I say cut out the middleman and get this Tuscan Whole Milk on Amazon, imported from the famous dairy barns of Tuscany!

When I saw all the positive reviews for Tuscan Whiole Milk, I knew this was what I needed and so I bought three  containers.  So when I got to needing the milk in the recipe, the first step was easy. Twisting the cap off allowed me to easily pour in the sugar that was needed (but strangely left out of the recipe). And I quickly learned to pour it slowly so that I could mix it in without having the milk spill out of the container. So far, so good.  And the top screwed easily back on. Fantastic! But the next step is where I feel that my fellow reviewers let me down. I put the milk jug on the floor and jumped on it, surprised to see it come pouring out of the container!  That was odd, as the reviews led me to believe this milk is perfect. So I took the second jug, poured in the sugar, and then placed it under my car tire and slowly drove over it. What a mess! Yet again, I had thought this milk would perform better than this. So I had to write to warn others: while this milk sweetened ok, it apparently is not good enough to condense. Buyers beware!  I guess I'll have to figure out something else to do with the third container.",

I didn't speak much Italian and my only friend was my mother.The small village was mostly older people but I did find a couple of children, slightly older than me, but children nonetheless. They didn't speak much English either but we somehow made it work. We ran the dusty streets and gentle sloping hills of the country side. We played the same as millions of children in The States, until sunset.Weary from a days play I would meander in and I would smell the wonderful smell of pasta and sauce slowly drifting from the small kitchen my mother was in. I would take my dirty cloths off and bath not realizing how hungry I indeed was. I put on my night cloths and wandered into the kitchen and sat down. My father was home by then and my mother served him first, I came second, and she last. We weren't Italian but mother always did a wonderful job preparing Italian food. I always drank milk for dinner but this time something was different. It was milk alright but something was different. This milk seemed to glow from the cup. The smell of rich cream and fresh milking was rising into my nostrils. It flooded my my mind with a tangent of aromas. The ice cold milk caused the outside of the cup to condensate with water. I wrapped my fingers around the ice cold cup of milk and slowly raised it to my waiting lips. As the deliciousness poured over my lips onto my eager tongue I waited to swallow. I wanted to savor this moment and this glorious refreshment. The rich and flavorful milk awakened taste buds in my mouth that have never been awoken before. Slowly, I let the coolness trickle down my throat. This was indeed a treat to behold. Mind you, I've had milk before but this was a whole different experience. I didn't chug the milk because a beverage this fine deserves to be nourished. My mother must have noticed my enjoyment and asked if I liked the milk, eagerly I shook my head and said yes very much so. She said this is a new milk, it is from right here in Tuscany. For the next two years I had the privilege and delight to partake of this Tuscan Whole Milk. When we moved I remembered feeling lost knowing that I'd never be able to drink it again but it still lingered just on the edge of my pallet. I tried many different milks since but nothing ever compared.I had thought all was lost until, one night, while searching for Christmas gifts. I decided to take a shot in the dark and search amazon.com for this milk. To my surprise it was here! Tears weld up in my eyes. My hands trembled as I entered my information. I still haven't received it yet but I can wait to taste this amazing milk again it's been many years since and I know that when I do everything in the world will be whole again.",

It's almost impossibly quiet, as I don't think I'e ever heard it bark. Training Tuscan Whole Milk to do tricks, though, has proven impossible. I think my batch may have been born deaf.

I took the lid off, the quality of craftsmanship went unnoticed as I began to panic.  I shook that carton and nothing.  I then placed it between my legs and did the old thigh master technique squeezing out the milk like toothpaste.  Even though it looked like thick mayonnaise,.... I sliced off about an inch of milk,  put it in my jigger and threw it back.  I suffered from a little gag reflex and the texture made my eyes water,  but after repeating 9-10 times,  I found it quite pleasant and very smooth,  even after some got stuck between my teeth.  I thigh mastered some into my cereal bowl over my honey nut cheerios and mixed it together,... It reminded me of the days when grabbing a handful of cookie dough from my mother's mixing bowl.

If you're the organic type and want to avoid chemicals it makes the perfect skin wash that makes you feel clean and OH SO SOFT! It's been said that Cleopatra took milk baths, and there's a darned good reason she did. Amazing skin! THAT is what you get with Tuscan milk, and the more you use...the better! I honestly think my wrinkles are going away (my stomach seems flatter and my buttocks is tighter too!), people often comment on my \"creamy\" skin. A friend recently started using it as a hair conditioner, but I haven't tried it yet, will try it with my avocado/banana hair pack I'm mixing up in a few days. Highly recommended at ANY price! You'll need at least 16-20 gal. per milk bath, which may seem to be a bit pricey, but if you want to be a drop dead gorgeous as Cleopatra, it's worth it. Unfortunately, there's NO organic version of this fantastic milk (at the price you're paying it SHOULD BE!) but a little bovine recombinant growth hormone won't hurt your outsides as much as it will your insides.

There I was at 6:00 AM, groggy and groping for some milk to go with my Grape Nuts.  Little did I know this would be the start of a grand adventure.  My paw landed on the plastic of this magical jug.

The first spoonful instantly woke me up, fatigue washed away with the creamy coldness of this elixir.\"Oh, you're trying the new milk!\"  I hadn't even heard my roommate coming down the stairs.\"WHAT?\"  I replied.  As anyone who has eaten Grape Nuts will tell you...well...you can't hear s*** when you're eating them.\"I didn't say anything...and why are you shouting?\" Replied my roommate with a puzzled look on his face.\"OH...\"What was going on here?  His voice sounded like it was coming from inside my head!  Did I just hear his thoughts?  I stopped chewing and listened for more.  What happened next changed my life forever.I heard a jumble of sentences and thoughts from not only my puzzled roommate, but also from all around the neighborhood.  Then all around the state.  If I stopped chewing long enough, I had no doubt I could have heard the thoughts of every being on the planet.Without a word, I grabbed the jug, along with my Grape Nuts and ran for my room.\"This is amazing...imagine the good I can do with this!\"  What followed over the next few years is a tale for another time.  I was recruited by the CIA.  I was hunted from Colorado to Prague by every three-letter agency in the world.  I stopped so many world-ending events, I lost count years ago.  I only felt the danger of my new life when this Tuscan Whole Milk magical elixir was unavailable, and I had run though my emergency stashes.I fear I must end this by asking you to take this as a cautionary tale.  Order it.  Enjoy it.  But only if you are prepared to shoulder the enormous responsibility of your new powers.  You will be hunted, exploited, chased to the ends of Gaia.  But you will have the power to change the outcome of every major event in your lifetime.I gotta run.  They will be here in two minutes and twelve seconds, exactly.  You've been warned.P.S.

For me, milk falls into that category of product which must have an accomplice to become palatable; milk and cereal, milk and cookies, etc etc.  I am pretty much the same with cigarettes; cigarettes and beer, cigarettes and police stations; and very much the same with cocaine; cocaine and whores, cocaine and er... whores.  But I digress.Lets see, what do we have here then... oh, on the label, it's a cow jumping over the moon, just like in that nursery rhyme.  Except this moon is yellow, almost like it has jaundice.  Seems a bit odd.  Still, better a cow jumping over a jaundice moon than a cow jumping over what could also be interpreted as the sun, what with its low-lying udder exposed to the blazing radiant heat and thus curdling the milk.  That ain't cool, pun intended.And the brand name, Tuscan, is sending shivers down my spine too.  It implies the high probability that this here fine product was brewed in Tuscany by a clan of old Italian men.  I am an old Italian man myself, and between you and me, you really do not want the likes of me going anywhere near your breakfast staple.  I won't go into the repugnant details, but let's just say no amount pasteurisation can disguise the unfortunate osmosis of cheap cologne and malting nasal hair.And lastly, on the label, that obscure character to the right of the word MILK and to the left of the jaundice moon, what is that?  I have turned my internet settings spyglass thing to 400% and I still cannot make it out. Now,  I don't want to jump to conclusions nor cause mass panic, but while my heart tells me it's just a full stop/period or even a smiley face, my head it telling me it's an asterisk.An asterisk.  Jesus, Joseph and Mary, pray for our children.Anyways, so there you have it;  the jug of milk ain't half empty, but neither is it half full.  I give it a solid 3 stars.

    "body": "Whole Milk (Tuscany, Greece) is an artist who works in a variety of media. With a subtle minimalistic approach, Milk creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.His practice provides a useful set of allegorical tools for manoeuvring with a pseudo-minimalist approach in the world of art: these meticulously planned works resound and resonate with images culled from the fantastical realm of imagination. By using popular themes such as sexuality, family structure and violence, he uses a visual vocabulary that addresses many different social and political issues. The work incorporates time as well as space - a fictional and experiential universe that only emerges bit by bit.His works bear strong political references. The possibility or the dream of the annulment of a (historically or socially) fixed identity is a constant focal point. By merging several seemingly incompatible worlds into a new universe, he touches various overlapping themes and strategies. Several reoccurring subject matter can be recognised, such as the relation with popular culture and media, working with repetition, provocation and the investigation of the process of expectations.His works often refers to pop and mass culture. Using written and drawn symbols, a world where light-heartedness rules and where rules are undermined is created. By emphasising aesthetics, he seduces the viewer into a world of ongoing equilibrium and the interval that articulates the stream of daily events. Moments are depicted that only exist to punctuate the human drama in order to clarify our existence and to find poetic meaning in everyday life.His works doesn't reference recognisable form. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. With the use of appropriated materials which are borrowed from a day-to-day context, he presents everyday objects as well as references to texts, painting and architecture. Pompous writings and Utopian constructivist designs are juxtaposed with trivial objects. Categories are subtly reversed.His collected, altered and own works are being confronted as aesthetically resilient, thematically interrelated material for memory and projection. The possible seems true and the truth exists, but it has many faces, as Hanna Arendt cites from Franz Kafka. By questioning the concept of movement, he absorbs the tradition of remembrance art into daily practice. This personal follow-up and revival of a past tradition is important as an act of meditation.He creates situations in which everyday objects are altered or detached from their natural function. By applying specific combinations and certain manipulations, different functions and/or contexts are created. By applying abstraction, he creates work in which a fascination with the clarity of content and an uncompromising attitude towards conceptual and minimal art can be found. The work is aloof and systematic and a cool and neutral imagery is used.His works sometimes radiate a cold and latent violence. At times, disconcerting beauty emerges. The inherent visual seductiveness, along with the conciseness of the exhibitions, further complicates the reception of their manifold layers of meaning. By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience, he finds that movement reveals an inherent awkwardness, a humour that echoes our own vulnerabilities. The artist also considers movement as a metaphor for the ever-seeking man who experiences a continuous loss.His works isolate the movements of humans and/or objects. By doing so, new sequences are created which reveal an inseparable relationship between motion and sound.",

    "body": "The first thing that strikes you about Tuscan Whole Milk (I got the fully loaded 128 fl oz model) is the minimalism.  I spent half an hour failing to find the power switch, until my roommate, who is much more technical than I am, explained that Tuscan Whole Milk doesn't have one.  The user -- he explained the design philosophy to me -- shouldn't have to know whether his Tuscan Whole Milk is on or not; it's not part of what he's trying to do.  So the unit is *always* on:  it stays in sleep mode until you use it, and then it goes into full power mode without any further user intervention.  Talk about Steve Jobs, only even more so!But it's not *easy* on the user.  I expected to be able to simply point and click, but I couldn't find a 'pour' icon, and it turns out there isn't a trackpad or even a mouse.  Instead, the user interacts with Tuscan Whole Milk through a 'handle', a gripping device built into one side of the unit, that you insert your hand into; it can be lifted or tilted.  In a way, it's very elegantly conceived:  flow is controlled by angle of tilt, and flow destination by moving the unit as a whole, via its handle, to a target bowl or glass.  It takes a little while to learn, but the 'pick up the handle and pour' metaphor is compelling, and radically innovative -- the biggest step forward in interface design since the glove.Being fixated on the controlling metaphor isn't always a good thing, however. Users are used to point and click interfaces, and these should be provided as an option.  And I was curious about what other software packages were available for the Tuscan Whole Milk, and how they would exploit the handle interface.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that there *aren't any*.  That's right, there's no app store, no third party vendors online.  And even if you found a third party app, you couldn't install it.  There's no internet connectivity, not even a USB port.  Tuscan Whole Milk is dedicated single-purpose hardware.Apropos:  Another reviewer says he rooted and bricked his unit.  Frankly, I'm skeptical.  As far as I can tell, user access to the OS is completely blocked -- I couldn't even get a shell terminal -- and I don't see how he could have done it.Worse, Tuscan Whole Milk isn't rechargeable.  There's no way even to plug it in.  Once your Tuscan Whole Milk is 'empty'(indicated by the 'fluid level' on the external display reaching the bottom of the unit), you're supposed to throw it out.  So it's not just single-purpose hardware, it's *disposable*.  Elegance is elegance, but this is taking a nice idea way too far.Although I'm disappointed with what was made of a very promising user interface concept, I have to mention the graphics, which almost make up for it.  When you pour, the 'milk' looks absolutely convincing; the algorithm team managed something special here.  The animation was so good that it actually fooled my cat, who drank some of the Tuscan Whole Milk.",

They say Tuss as in a walrus tusk when really the sound is closer to Tooth. Think tooth-kon.Now, to open the jug one does not simply unscrew the cap. The proper method is, while seated, to hold the jug by tightly pinching its cap so that it is suspended between 5\" and 6\" above one's lap. Then, grip the handle with the index and middle finger of your non-dominant hand and rotate the jug(!), and not the cap.You'll know the bottle is open when the jug hits your lap - it's this thud that really activates the flavor. Tip: Should you be fortunate enough to have droplets of the Tuscan Whole Milk emerge from the bottle, do chase these droplets with your mouth as these will generally have the greatest concentration of nutrients. You'll notice how much more nutrienty the droplets taste.Now, leave the jug open to let it breathe. How long you say? Each jug is different, but if you listen with a stethoscope placed on the upper portion of the jug beneath the spout you should hear it begin to hum the distinctive Tuscan(tm) tone when the jug is ready. Here's a bit of trivia: most people believe there are seven natural music notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) but there is an 8th. The note \"T\" - the Tuscan(tm) tone.(Somewhere on eBay, someone claims to be selling a Grandest Piano, which, unlike a Grand Piano which has only 88 keys, also includes 7 more T keys.

    "body": "\"Daddy,\" Stephen said, his voice starting to break on the other end of the line. He was only three and a half years old but the pain in his voice was unmistakable and pure, the way it always tends to be with children of a young age. \"My cereal... milk... I need milk...\"I knew then that this was a serious matter. I'd been there before myself. A victim of an unfortunate circumstance decades prior where the last bit of Cinnamon Toast Crunch I had poured myself had been tainted by the last bit of milk we had left in the house. Milk that had turned nearly three days prior. I realized it after the second spoonful, tasting what seemed to me like a mixture of old, sharp cheese and cinnamon toast.It didn't help matters either to picture myself pouring the last of the milk into my coffee that morning without a second thought. I was usually good about things like that, leaving enough of something in particular for those still in the house when I left for work every morning. But that morning, the call of milk for my coffee was too great.I gripped the phone tightly, the work in front of me long forgotten. I knew I'd have to make a stop at the supermarket on the way home. How much time did I have to wipe away the grief from his undeniably broken heart? I figured I had about an hour, maybe fifty minutes if I left right then and there.\"I'll get you your milk, Stephen.\" I said. \"I'll get you your milk. You can count on it.\"I heard him sniffle once or twice before he handed the phone back to my wife. I knew what she was going to say just as much as I had already known what it was that I had to do.I had to make things right.I stepped off the subway nearly two hours later. A normal day would've guaranteed no more than an hour long ride to get home but I didn't take the blizzard we had just been socked with into account. I spent at least twenty minutes at Times Square with another forty minutes added to the ride at 96th Street. The veins in my temple were throbbing as I walked into the supermarket, flurries of snow falling from my hair and shoulders. The place was a disaster. I saw two women to my left fighting over a length of kielbasa, venom spitting from their mouths in hushed tones. I uttered a silent prayer, hoping I wouldn't find the same sort of scene in the dairy section. I turned into the cool air of the dairy aisle and stopped in my tracks when I saw that there was no milk left.Up until then, I'd never experienced those moments you see in the movies, the ones where all the sound goes out, replaced by only a thudding heartbeat and a high pitched tone that sounds like someone just flatlined in the ER, another recently departed poor soul in a history of departed poor souls. But right then I did. I knew I'd be able to go to a local bodega and get a gallon of milk there but there was something in that moment that defeated me. Old memories flared up and for a moment, strange yet almost comforting in its familiarity, I could taste the rancid, sour sweet taste of dead milk in the back of my throat. The image of me dropping to my knees and screaming up at the ceiling filled my mind and seemed to be in my immediate future when a flash of movement from the rear of the store caught my eye, stopping all train of thought.A flash of white color.I started moving through the aisle, pushing past an old man trying to make sense of the day's offerings in the circular. The man I saw emerge from the back of the supermarket was wearing a white butcher's coat, stained with long dried blood from the day's work. I felt a sense of disappointment, believing that I'd fallen victim to my own hopes, that is, until I looked down. He was pushing a hand truck, loaded with crates of fresh Tuscan milk stacked on top of one another.Sound rushed back into my world, the sound of my heartbeat retreating to the back of the auditorium that was my everyday world. I didn't exactly storm over to him but my footsteps thudded on the ground, footsteps of a man with a mission.I yanked a gallon out of the crate by the handle, feeling the ice cold milk inside greet me with its coolness. I knew what it would taste like because I'd had it before, not just once but many times over the course of my life. It was the perfect thing to add to a bowl of cereal and better yet, it was still fresh with at least another week and a half to go before it would turn. More than enough time to get home to my son so he could have his cereal in the proper fashion. With good old fashioned, vitamin D laced milk.\"Thank you,\" I said to the man in the white coat, patting him on the back and ending it with a hearty squeeze of the shoulder. \"Thank you.\" He stood there, not really knowing what to say for a moment before beginning to restock the milk section. He never took his eyes from me but I think he knew. He knew that there was more at stake here than what it looked like. The milk wasn't for me and he knew that. Maybe he had a boy of his own, maybe not. But he knew.On the way home, I felt a sense of relief. I'd gotten Stephen his milk and the people at Tuscan would be happy to know that they helped a little boy get the smile on his face back. I smiled.Above, the snow continued to fall from the sky.

The worst part of the purchase was awaiting its arrival and I missed two days of work worried with anticipation.The sound of a diesel engine and squeaky brakes was the climax of my anticipation knowing that the FedEx truck was certainly near. Before the driver could unbuckle his seat belt I was already rummaging through the myriad of packages looking for my milk. After nearly 5 minutes of frantic searching, there it was, like a beacon in the night my Tuscan Whole Milk!I rushed into the house shaking like a dog passing peach pits, ready to pour the nectar of the gods over a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch that had been carefully prepared the night before. Unfortunately the packaging was like trying to break into Fort Knox and I nearly wet myself with excitement. After locating a razor knife I ever so carefully made the necessary cuts to free my Tuscan Whole Milk from the restraints that  imprisoned the ecstasy I had been anticipating. Finally free from its containment I removed the milk and to my utter dismay the jug was filled with a rancid chunk of clumpy, congealed, foulness that had no similarity to the dairy delight I envisioned so many nights in my dreams.At this point I absolutely lost my cool. I ran screaming from the house literally smashing through the patio door nearly severing my finger but that would have to wait. I smashed my car window with a brick and kicked in the door like an MMA fighter would kick his opponent. At this point I guess you could say the entire neighborhood was \"aware\" that I was unhappy. My neighbor came over to try and diffuse the situation which didn't turn out well for him when he found himself on the receiving end of a nasty throat punch! I vaguely remembering hearing someone saying \"call 911\" but that was no deterrent for my anger. I took my anger out of shrubs, fences, mailboxes, small forest animals, and a stray cat or two. The flashing red and blues had no effect on my rage and soon I found myself on the receiving end of a tazer which caused my bladder and bowels to leak all over the street. After being treated for multiple cuts, bruises, contusions, and a concussion I was booked into jail and given a court date. Luckily I found another inmate that had a similar experience with Tuscan Whole Milk and he contacted his wife to place another order for the both of us. My new gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk should be just in time for my homecoming and I know that this time it will be everything I anticipate it to be.",

While I was admiring them, I heard a small 'plink' in my glass. I thought nothing of it. I took a sip of my milk, setting down the flowers on the table. The milk was slightly warm, as were my boyfriends eyes as he watched me drink.  I took a few sips, slowly finishing the glass when I began to choke. He began to panic as I swallowed the object I had been choking on. He grabbed my hand, pulling me towards the door. \"We need to get you to the hospital.\" I shook my head, assuring him he was fine, but he carried me to the car, speeding to get to the hospital. He talked to the nurse while I waited in the chair.  She laughed, paging a doctor to come take a look at me.  The doctor came and took us to a private room. She did an x-ray of my torso, only to find a ring in my stomach. My boyfriend looked over at me, a shy look on his face. \"I planned on proposing to you over a glass of milk, because how we met was in the dairy section of Pick 'N' Save. But, as you can see, it clearly didn't go too well.\" I sighed, laughing slightly. \"Well, aren't you going to ask?\" I smirked at him. He gulped, then nodded. \"Bev, will you be my wife, forever and for always?\"\"Hell no.

Although, after ingesting large quantities over the course of a month, I built up a tolerance and eventually the extreme diarrhea dissipated.Overall, I would highly recommend the Tuscan Cheese, and have tried contacting the seller in regards to getting a reorder, although they informed me that there is no such thing.

I thought to myself, \"I have to try that.\"  So I got out my credit card, and ordered a gallon.It was going to take five business days for delivery.

I hated to rush the use of milk of such high caliber, but sometimes these types of sacrifices must be made for the greater good.

As reruns of \"Charles in Charge\" played unwatched on the television, and we went over projected sales figures for the next quarter, I noticed his paunch, his thinning hairline and the gray nose hairs as if for the first time.And as the passion built over our shared room service meal of jalapeno poppers, an undercooked turkey burger that later gave me severe gastrointestinal distress and a hot fudge sundae that arrived more or less totally melted, I gave in.  Manolo's air of middle-aged defeat, the droopy and sad look in his eyes that spoke of years of dreams unachieved, of expectations never met and of the soul-crushing existence of middle management at a large corporation won me over.

He was dying.  And so I went to the hospital where he lay, and was shocked at the sight of his frail body.  It was an ingrown nosehair, he told me.  He didn't have much longer to live.I was now married with children.  The multi-billionaire CEO of a successful tech company.

    "body": "A young man had been to Wednesday night Bible Study. The Pastor had shared about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man couldn't help but wonder, \"Does God still speak to people?\" After service he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked about how God had led them in different ways. It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, \"God...If you still speak to people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey.\" As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought to stop and buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. He shook his head and said out loud, \"God is that you?\" He didn't get a reply and started on toward home. But again, the thought, buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz. The young man thought about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how little Samuel ran to Eli. \"Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 fl oz.\" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could always use the Tuscan Whole Milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk and started off toward home. As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, \"Turn Down that street.\" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he said out loud, \"Okay, God, I will\".He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in semi commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.Again, he sensed something, \"Go and give the Tuscan Whole Milk to the people in the house across the street.\" The young man looked at the house. It was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. \"Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and if I wake them up, they are going to be mad and I will look stupid.\" Again, he felt like he should go and give the Tuscan Whole Milk. Finally, he opened the door, \"Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will give them the Tuscan Whole Milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something but if they don't answer right away, I am out of here.\" He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise inside. A man's voice yelled out, \"Who is it? What do you want?\" Then the door opened before the young man could get away.The man was standing there in his jeans and T-shirt. He looked like he just got out of bed. He had a strange look on his face and he didn't seem too happy to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. \"What is it?\" The young man thrust out the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, \"Here, I brought this to you.\" The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the Tuscan Whole Milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was crying. The man had tears streaming down his face.The man began speaking and half crying, \"We were just praying. We had some big bills this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any Tuscan Whole Milk for our baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some Tuscan Whole Milk.\"His wife in the kitchen yelled out, \"I ask him to send an Angel with some. Are you an Angel?\" The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him after paying $2,500 for the milk  and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward his car and the tears were streaming down his face. He knew that God still still speaks to people to buy Tuscan Whole Milk.",

And anyway, dairy cows can take up a bit too much space in my studio apartment, not to mention the cost of hay, the constant mooing, and the manure piled all over the apartment.But let's get back to this succulent white creamy wave of liquid bovine heaven which mere mortals have named \"Tuscan's Milk\" ...  Nothing, but nothing, can prepare you for your first taste of this \"udder ecstasy\" ... from the moment it touches your lips, and passes down into your grateful stomach, to the time it gives you lactose-intolerant induced diahrrea, you'll be thanking those Tuscan cows for all their hard work and dedication.  And just think - with all those added hormones and other pharamaceuticals, you'll never need to take anitbotics again! (just hope you never run into any of those pesky antibiotic-resistant flesh eating bacterias, but if you do, rest assured that soaking in a bath of Tuscan's milk will be a quick and effective cure).One added benefit that I have observed while drinking this \"milk of the Gods\" is that I seem to have gotten incredibly strong.  So strong in fact, that I no longer have to drive my car to work, but can simply poke my feet through the floor and run it \"Flinstone's style\" for my entire 45 mile commute!  Sure, I might get some weird looks from my fellow commuters, but it saves on gas and is a great form of exercise too! And that's not all!  Since drinking Tuscan's milk, my feet seem to be hardening and taking on the shape of hooves, which means I will no longer be a slave to fashionable yet expensive and uncomfortable shoes. Thanks, Tuscan's!To those of you thinking about buying regular milk in your local grocery to bypass the $30 expedited delivery fee, think about this: each gallon of milk bought from another brand means one more Tuscan's cow sent off to the unemployment line, forced to live on welfare and food stamps, which guarantees the rapid and spiralling decent into drug use and domestic violence for the cows and their families.

The shape of its vessel, the slight texture that begs its curves to be embraced... Such perfection can rarely be discovered in the mortal realm, much less delivered in 3-7 business days.I digress. I have never before reviewed a product from the Amazon, and I must choose my words carefully. Time is of the essence, and this will almost certainly be the last message I have the privilege to share with you.We've all been led to believe that, behind every good milk, there is a man. This is where the fairy tale has been blurred throughout time, with personal agendas and blasphemy. It is my duty to set things straight.That man is Thomas Edison.Suspend your disbelief. You've been led to believe that Edison invented the light bulb? I beg that you take this speculation with a grain of salt. He is an evil, manipulative individual, with ties to the most corrupt milk-running circle that has ever existed.You may notice that I referred to his qualities in the present tense. Ah, so you were also taught that he is no longer living? Please. Shut your textbooks and open your eyes. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, though now diluted with the nasty udder discharge from cattle, was once an elixir of immortality, developed by none other than Mr. Sparky the Light-Bulb-Face himself. It was all a cover, don't you see? Teachers and researchers love to focus on the 1,093 patents that Edison acquired (before he went into hiding, that is). They fail to mention, however, that most of these inventions were, in fact, instruments of torture. Their sole purpose was extracting information from the real inventors of the time. As they were beaten, stretched, and impaled, the inventors' tears were collected in a plastic jug, and were subsequently mixed with a supply of cow's milk, as his daily dose of creativity and calcium.I can hear his footsteps coming down the stairs. I must get to the point, or all of this will have been in vain.Our understandings of the origins of modern electricity are flawed, the product of countless bribes and hush money. The nutrition that fuels the white magic in your breakfast cereal is, in fact, the repressed and concentrated imagination and talent of countless inventors and scientists.Don't go to the police.

    "body": "I got this in the mail yesterday and let me say, I love Tuscan cows. In the morning, I awoke at dawn with a strange feeling of anticipation in the pit of my stomach. I went downstairs and I heard a buzzing sound. As the day progressed, the sound grew louder until, at length, I discerned that it was, in fact, the sound of many voices singing monotone. I didn't know at the time, but I was to be called to a higher purpose.Around noon, the mail came and I went out to see what we'd gotten. As I approached the mailbox, the singing grew louder and, when I noticed a large crate in the car, the singing changed tone.I retrieved the other mail and picked up the crate. It was heavy, as could be expected, and I brought it inside. I didn't open it immediately, choosing instead to look through the mail and waste 30 precious seconds.When I tore off the slats on the crate, grass from the fields of Tuscany spilled out onto the floor. The singing intensified and I saw a little red lid poking out from the grass. I pulled the carton of Tuscan Whole Milk from the crate and, in a trancelike state, I unscrewed the lid and poured a glass.The first sip was like heaven on my tongue, slowly inching its way down my throat in a creamy, frothy stream. When I set down my glass after that first sip, it was empty. The singing had stopped, but my heart was pounding in my ears like the beat of a bongo drum. I went outside to find that the Tuscan grass had replaced all the grass in my lawn and was waving in a light, warm breeze. Far off in the open pasture (i.e.: the fence near my neighbor) I saw cows grazing. The sun shone brightly and I felt at peace with the world.I got in my car, went to my girlfriend's house and apologized for a past argument because, despite it's many magical powers, Tuscan Whole Milk can not make you in the right in every argument unless the argument is about Tuscan Whole Milk.On the way back home I stopped in the middle of the road, got out and, for some inexplicable reason, called upon the cows of Tuscany. Suddenly, I was surrounded by a herd of cattle. There was a screech of tires and the wail of a siren. A car full of bank robbers had just been apprehended because of the cows.The police thanked me graciously, but I waved them away; I'm just using the power of Tuscan Whole Milk.Now my fiancee and I are planning a trip to Tuscany on our honeymoon. I certainly hope the crime rates in the city don't go up too much while I'm gone, since I now patrol the streets regularly, a carton of Tuscan Whole Milk on hand to fend of evil.Thank you, Tuscan Whole Milk and thank you, Tuscan Cows.",

I hadn't seen any action in the 4 days I'd been in that miserable swamp and my trigger finger was getting itchy. Looking back, I should have been careful what I wished for.Because that's when I was ambushed.Without warning a dozen men spilled from behind the leaves, armed to the teeth. I had mere seconds to react before gunfire rained around me.\"COME GET ME!\" I bellowed as I hoisted my rifle. I dove for cover and was able to get off a few rounds until my gun jammed. Before I even knew what was happening one of them was behind me. I spun around but he was too fast. I caught the stock end of his rifle full force to the face and it was lights out for me.I came to on the floor of a dusty wooden shack, the taste of blood in my mouth and the barrel of a gun in my face. There were at least six of them in the room and they demanded to know who I worked for.\"I'll never talk,\" I spat, which earned me swift and painful retribution. Despite having trained for situations like these, nothing could have prepared me for what was to come. They interrogated me for hours, introducing me to new levels of pain I had never thought possible. It was only after they shot me for the 3rd time that I knew I couldn't hold out much longer.At that point, as I swam in and out of consciousness, I became dimly aware of a mysterious figure enter the room and gun down all of my captors. Wearily, I lifted my head from the blood-soaked dirt floor to gaze at my savior.It was Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz who saved my life that day.",

This light and I, we share the type of bond which a child might share with a moth, the only living thing within unwalkable miles, which landed in your hand while tripping in the Mojave, only to die there, in the cupping embrace of your palms, your fingers overlapped for added cushion. Just you and the moth, and the Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, dying together in the grey blue light of the moon. Meanwhile, that same blue grey sky silhouettes rooftops with cartoon chimneys and wisps of smoke atop square yellow windows, where men such as myself sit, drinking Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, patiently awaiting the sounds of Jazz on the wind, unwillingly recalling the memories of a thirteen year old.  I remember it. I had imagined a red perforated line, boop boop boop, leading from my eye right to the yellow light, a 180 degree, perfect line. Just fold my reality along the dotted line, tear from the edge, and watch it all fall away. Afterward, include the return slip with your payment.  This moment was every moment, played out in grainy, distinct frames, all yellowed and repeating images reeling as old projectors do. At least three major revolutions must have happened in the third world by the time my senses settled. Then the perforation formed a 5 degree angle, as my line of sight slipped slightly upward toward the number: 17. Just then, I took a long, luscious sip of Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, my lips relishing the thick embrace, and the same number sounded above my head, ding, lit up in the same uninviting, sepia yellow.  And finally, after I\u2019d grown a rather impressive shadow for a thirteen year old, the familiar metallic elevator doors roll back on their tracks. I notice the tiny red light up in the corner of the track which senses my hand holding the Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, which is holding the door open for my brother. I turn around to face the room, a room usually full of light, action, men and women and downright kids in not-very-playful uniforms, prancing two and fro in a somewhat chaotic, yet obviously methodical waltz of efficiency. The room is empty. My thoughts seem to echo off the far wall, and when they return to my ears the sounds are distorted and multiplied. The wall ahead of me is made entirely of two panes of fogged glass, lit from the back in the ominous, familiar din and boring hum of hospital fluorescents. In that wall, right in the center, there is another jug of Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, and although I realize this was an ICU, and even though here, on my New York rooftop, with my cap an my pipe and my Charlie Parker, I know that there were all kinds of lights in that room; in my memory, it\u2019s dark. Dark except for the distant grey whir of the fluorescents, and one calm full spectrum light bulb above the Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces. Then I began to realize how far the door is ahead of me. Was this room designed by some mad experimental architect during his last job before he was put in a psych ward due to a split-personality disorder? One side of him attempting to build a funhouse- perhaps this would have been the maze of mirrors- while the other side tries to finish building a professional institution. Each step, as I traverse this warehouse of shadows, cast off looming surgical equipment and metallic tables from the shivering light of that ever more distant wall, is heavier than the last. This is what Sisyphus must have felt like. But my brother lowered his reassuring hand onto the center of my back (his hand covers nearly half of my torso), and smiled shakily at me through his long golden mop.  \u201cCome on,\u201d he managed to croak out, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a choice.\u201d The only thing I remember after that is my father\u2019s face. I see it more in Carl\u2019s smile than my own. The color of his skin: yellow. And his words. I may be remembering wrong. I was completely checked out at this point. He asked us to forgive him. And how can someone deny in a situation like this? I let him go in peace. He asked us for milk. I said \"no.\" I figured this wasn\u2019t the time for arguing. Now, exhaling my smoke into the brisk, already disgusting night air of the city, where it will mingle with the sounds of laughter and jazz, and the aromatic taste of Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon 128 fluid ounces, and be carried away through the clouds, where maybe my father will catch a whiff and an earful and a little taste of Tuscan Whole Milk 1 gallon/128 fluid ounces, and be reminded and pleased, if for only a moment. Now I wish I would have screamed at him. I should have yelled and asked him \u201cHow dare you, dad? Screw you for taking this last memory of mine!\u201d Well, he had the last word. Again.

I didnt actually think it would cure my chronic rectal bleeding, or even taste any different from regular milk for that matter. Oh how wrong I was!Not only is my anus and rectum as fresh and new as the day I was born, but it tasted very much as I remember the sublime ambrosia from my mothers breasts tasting like. I recall that flavor well, since my mother breast-fed me well into my teens. Interestingly, she was my adopted mother, but her work as a wet-nurse meant there was plenty of her love amber to go around. Even my father started breast-feeding again. But we digress.This milk is truly miraculous, and I seldom use that word. Mainly because it's ugly and sounds like vacuous, a word my father uses for my biological mother Bertha Ann.So buy and consume this overwhelmingly mouth-watering, magnificent, majestic, and miraculous milk....even if you dont have rectal bleeding.",

These last few years have been particularly subpar, depressing even.  In our Journey of Many Laments to Nepal, we stumbled upon a curious village in the himalayas.The local shaman greeted us at the airport in his 1967 Ford GT 40 and provided food and lodging in his flat.  After acclimating to the harsh conditions, our vigor was rejuvenated.  He then kindly directed us to what we now consider our first real breakthrough in the search. The shaman brought us to the aristocratic monk troup 509. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, these monks practice the rare art of cold fusion. After the intense initiation, we became brothers of the clan. After a fortnight of pillow fights and toga parties in celebration of our success, a poignant epiphany of our rash decision came to light. We couldn't afford the 5 dollar initiation fees.  Leaving in shame we visited the local walmart. And it was there that we saw a man in a green pair of taco pants that glistened with the sauted oil of onions and fruit snacks.  This man looked at us with a strange expression chiseled on face. It was a mixture of anguish and enlightenment. We asked the man 'Are you selling any milk?'  He replied with a furtive look to a cloud shaped like a bong in a whirlwind, 'Yes. Tuscan whole milk extracted from the teets Chuck Norris'.",

    "body": "What can be said about Tuscon whole milk?  Plenty of people have covered it's many virtues as a beverage, relationship saver, or even it's life changing abilities.  But as a survivor of a recent zombie outbreak in my hometown (you haven't heard about it due to the government covering it up), I can attest that milk is one of the most valuable anti-zombie defenses you can have in your zombie survival kit.  Forget crowbars, first aid kits, or even Molotov cocktails...a gallon of Tuscon whole milk is THE greatest defense you can have on hand.For one thing, milk is much more delicious then water.  When zombies cut off your water supply, you'll be forced to drink blood, dew from your rooftop, or any other manner of disgusting moisture.  But the zombies can do nothing about the milk stored in your fridge.  If you've stockpiled milk (preferably several gallons), then you'll have a delicious beverage that not only tastes better then water, it's also great for breakfast.  Nothing cheers you up during the zombie apocalypse like a bowl of cereal flavored with milk.Secondly, Tuscan whole milk is packed full of nutrients and vitamins that you'll need to keep your body in shape when fighting off the undead hordes.  After a long day of punching off rotten heads, and running several miles without a break, Tuscan whole milk has tons of protein that's the perfect fuel for building new muscles, so that when you wake up the following morning, your muscles will have recovered and are stronger then ever.  Not like those poor folks down the street who didn't have any milk to drink after their zombie based exercise.  They're all dead now.  Not like me, for Tuscon whole milk gave me the vital nutrients I needed to fight off the undead.Perhaps most importantly, Tuscan whole milk has lots of calcium, which you'll need to help maintain a strong skeletal system and ensure you'll have rock hard bones that won't break.  I drank plenty of milk during the outbreak, and my bones were rock hard, which allowed me to perform awesome kicks and leap from rooftops, landing safely and without injury.  Not like my poor neighbors, who hadn't been drinking Tuscan milk, and had their legs shatter on impact, leaving them helpless against undead teeth.  I wish I could forget their screams, but at least I'm still alive to spread the word about how vital milk is when it comes to surviving a zombie outbreak.All in all, though I had help during my time in zombie hell, nothing contributed more to my survival then Tuscan whole milk.  Without it, I would be rotting on the streets, another mindless being seeking to slaughter others.  But with my supply of milk on hand, I avoided such a horrible fate.  And while I may never emotionally recover from what I saw and endured, I can at least thank Tuscan for providing the nutrients I needed to survive.  Thanks to them, I'm at least able to move on with my life, and continue my search for true love.",

Their first release Whole Milk rocketed them to fame in the late 70s, and remains a fan favorite to this day.Fans of Tuscan Whole Milk were split over subsequent releases of 2% Reduced Fat and 1% Reduced Fat.  Some said the band were selling out.  Others emphatically insisted the band was just changing with the times.  No matter which side of that fence you were on, their latest release \"1 Gallon, 128 fl oz Red Label\" is a treat.  Red Label will likely prove to be to Tuscan Whole Milk what Hot Rocks was to the Rolling Stones --- a lot of the best in one beautiful package.Red Label is a long-playing version of the classic 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz fan favorite.  Tuscan Whole Milk Red Label is a release that defies immediate classification or description, simply because it's so obviously a turning point for Tuscan Whole Milk that only time proves capable of shifting into eventual perspective.Each and every ounce of the Red Label release can't fail but take you completely in, proving that Tuscan Whole Milk is still the leader in quenching the world's thirst for the best.  Tuscan Whole Milk Red Label provides a real explosion of indie driving rhythm on even the slowest day of the week.  Tuscan Whole Milk Red Label is not overproduced, as is so common of lesser entries these days.  No, Tuscan Whole Milk Red Label is packaged like a grunge guitar chord that makes you want to just pop your top and swig like a hillbilly on his day off.Tuscan Whole Milk plays with so much passion and challenge that the Red Label '09 tour is something that can't be missed. Tuscan Whole Milk doesn't need to play at lesser venues, so don't look for them there.  Tuscan Whole Milk plays best in larger arenas that can accommodate fist-pumping crowds who can scream along with every last drop.",

    "body": "There I was in the train station. My heart pounded and jumped like the pebbles on the track as the train approached. Would I recognize him? After all, it had been a whole summer -- my first summer -- without Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.As the passengers poured out of the cars and into the arms of long-lost lovers or bent over to scoop up their young children, faces beaming, I craned my neck to get a glimpse of something familiar - that milky white hue, the red cap he always wore.After a few seconds that could have been a thousand years, I saw him. He looked the same, the same one-gallon frame holding those 128 fluid ounces of raw sexuality. But one look told me things would never be the same between us. I knew then that something had changed this summer.\"Hey,\" I said, holding back tears. \"You look fantastic. Want to get out of here?\"He didn't answer. He was, after all, 1 gallon, 128 fl. oz. of milk.We slipped over to a cafe a few blocks away. It was the kind where young couples would go to sit out on the sidewalk and be seen. Passersby would look over and wish they could have just a little bit of the happiness and excitement these young people were conspicuously enjoying. The love was palpable. Sickening.We slipped inside to the counter.Catching up was easy enough. I told him all about law school, mentioning the friends I had made along the way, their hopes and dreams. I left out that one evening with soy lattes, of course, but I didn't have to. He could see in my eyes that the long summer in the big city had driven a wedge between us.The summer had changed him, too. He was curdled from days of laying out on sandy beaches, but no matter. I loved him just the same. As I reached past him for the sugar, I took a furtive sniff at his cap. The pungent odor betrayed just how much he had changed. I didn't mind that he was spoiled. I just wanted him to take me, right there, in front of all those people. One more time. Just to let them see what love actually is. It's not love when it's pure and white, it's love when it's chunky and smelly and you don't care. It's about need, not desire.I paid our check and walked out of the cafe. The sun was going down, half shining behind the skyscrapers. I looked at him one more time, hoping to catch some glimpse of the way he used to see me.It wasn't there.Our day was civil -- there's no other way to describe it -- but things had changed. That long summer robbed us of our relationship, but it robbed us of so much more. Our innocence was shattered.We said our goodbyes on the corner before going our separate ways.\"Hey,\" I called after him, \"I'll call you sometime.\" He didn't reply, he just looked back and smiled.I knew then we would never be going back to Tuscany.",

I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milk.Everyone knows nascut (an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of t-u-s-c-a-n) is Romanian for \"born\" (specifically, the past participle of naste). So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern, rather than Southern, Europe, and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean. Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles, and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour, is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote, \"A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step\"?As for the question of color over origin, we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation. To be sure, the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow. But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum.

    "body": "The latest whole milk offering from Tuscan, introduced at this year's CES, was a clear upgrade from their last offering. The earlier version, while a compelling idea, had a number of limitations that prevented it from competing with other leaders in the new social dairy medium. It showed promise, however, in its ambitious attempts at elegantly fusing a number of niche products into something more pocketable and financially available for the dairy hobbyist. Even throwing in some features that were previously the sole territory of the prosumer-level cheeses and baconnaises, the Tuscan has been the it-girl of the connected refrigerated goods market. Do the new features really differentiate it from the ambitious but unfulfilling initial product? Read more after the cut.(read more)1. The operating systemWhile the original was a WinMo beverage, the addition of Android has added support for already implemented cereal-topping hardware. This feature alone warrants an upgrade, but people considering purchasing Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz might want to consider waiting on the promised Eclair update scheduled to be pushed OTA in the beginning of next quarter. No plans to support Froyo have yet been announced, but hopes are high due to some stray notes in the blessedly open source of Tuscan's MilkBottle custom interface.2. ConnectivityThe original version, while software-upgradeable, fails in one key aspect; it is limited to use near a wifi hotspot. The addition of a SIM slot in the new hardware will allow you to pour milk on the go, though drinking milk is still reserved for wifi usage. Fan site TusLait has gotten a leak from a trusted source within Tuscan that implies that this limitation is entirely within software, and the lock was put in place to ensure that their relationship with AT&T; for their wireless support would continue. Expect a rooted version of the firmware to disable the lock soon.3. The displayThe larger 52\" display of the new iteration of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz improved readability, even including a wider viewing angle and more accurate multitouch. Sadly, they haven't improved on the weight, and you're still going to need the included stand to do any serious reading on this. Holding the three-ton, steam-powered behemoth while reading on the subway is a strain after several minutes. Rotating into landscape is questionable as well, as the tilt sensor is not very sensitive. To coax the device into triggering the autorotate, it is almost guaranteed that the milk will spill all over the floor. Beyond this, we also found that the exhaust from the coal burner that powers this monster of a multipurpose dairy dispenser is intensely noxious and will cause intense nausea if used in an enclosed space.4. Battery lifeThe battery is still pitifully small, hardly lasting long enough to power the device on. As it lacks any charger or mains plug, it is vital that you have a sufficient supply of coal on hand to power Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. We had hoped that they would be able to improve uptime on the included 25 D-cell batteries, but any improvements seem to be lost in powering the argon-neon backlight element for the larger display. Now I have to buy coal. So much coal.5. CoalFull disclosure, Tuscan has employed this writer as a coal miner for their new Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. To provide the necessary juice, I mine coal for 10 hours of each day. Due to technical constraints, I am no longer able to provide my wife the attention she deserves, and she has taken my children away to be with Steve, who will provide for her and the kids. It takes 2000 lb (1 ton) of coal to pour milk for 10 minutes continuously, and that same ton can keep the milk for 2 hours on standby. If reception is poor, those times halve, so I cannot stray more than 5 miles from the Tuscan headquarters at the northern tip of Alaska.6. AlaskaEach resident of Alaska received $1,305.00 from the Permanent Fund in 2009, but this was immediately spoken for by my Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. I am uncertain of how the device communicated with me, as it has no internal speakers and is woefully limited by its 2.5mm headphone/mic jack for which I do not own any accessories. I am fairly certain that it is powered by the black magicks of this place, but we will have to wait for results from the iFixit teardown. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz has told me not to allow the teardown, and my will becomes weaker with each passing day. The screen will only display the faces of a rotating cadre of elder gods, and the boundary between dream and reality becomes thinner all the time. Each time the sun sets I fear it will not rise again, as the days become more brief and the night, and the terrors that lie within, dominate to day.7. My wifeTell my wife I am sorry. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is too powerful. I must find more coal for Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. She was right. Tell her I love her. Tell Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz I love her. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz her. Oh Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.

One rather snowy day as class was starting, Lady Orchard poured herself a nice large glass of 'Tuscan Whole Milk' (not the whole gallon now, she's not that crazy!) when something a little peculiar happened. Each sip she took, another one of her students was turned into a different mythical creature. One a dragon, one a unicorn, and etcetera. This worried Lady Orchard greatly, for King Nelson was going to survey the classrooms in just a few short hours. She tried everything to turn them back. She tried calling in Knight McCallum the wise to Witch McMillon. NOTHING WORKED!!!Chapter 2Lady Orchard was worried. She did not think she had actually taken 23 sips of the rather mad milk! Maybe her Zumba teacher could help her! She was a witch! She even used Cravendale milk to give her cats thumbs!!! She rushed over to her Zumba teachers hut to find her pinned down by all her kittens with thumbs! Lady Orchard was very confused on why her sweet kittens would do such a thing! Then she realized what Queen Lisa (The Zumba teacher) had nuzzled in between her arm and her side... Cravendale! The Cravendale was the key!!!Chapter 3Lady Orchard, who just realized she had left her class unattended, pried all the cats off of Queen Lisa. This task proved to be rather difficult since the cats had claws and thumbs. Once the task was done, Lady Orchard ran to the nearest by market to get her Cravendale, and quickly rushed back to her classroom. But alas, by the time she got there, King Nelson was standing furiously in the doorway. Once Lady Orchard got closer to her room, she realized that the animals had breed, and now there were four times as many mythical creatures as there were when she left!!! Before she explained to King Nelson what had happened, she drank the whole gallon (YES! This time the whole gallon!) of the Cravendale milk. Nothing happened.To Be Continued...",

Since then, it has been the best reviewed of Gus Van Zant career. However, had I known was merely a remake before I saw it, I would have seen the original first. But such was not the case.So, I hesitantly ordered this \"Tuscan Milk\" on Amazon (it finally arrived last week over the holidays (I also used Super Saver Shipping). As much as I like European products, I have to admit that, in this instance, the American version is most certainly better (well, this and The Office!).In this version, there simply is no stand-out performance like Sean Penn's. While you are kept abreast of the story throughout, it will initially leave you ice-cold, and the the depth of it fails to last as long as you'd like it to. As a matter of fact, the only character in the whole thing is Phlegm and he doesn't show up til just as the movie ends! The visuals are amateur at best: all shots of it are completely blown out (even in absolute darkness, you can still make out the pale white image).While not exactly formulaic, in the end, there is a homogenized feel to the whole thing. It leaves a taste in your mouth for something more, perhaps Chocolat?Side note: the movie poster of a cow jumping over the moon has NOTHING to do with gay rights. But it could be an italian inside joke or something.It's not bad, a little bland, but i'd stick with the movie still currently in theaters.",

    "body": "Hello.I want to share my story with the world.Perhaps some people can learn from it. Maybe even some will be changed in some small way.I know I was.~~~~~ It all started long, long ago.... *smoke billows as we go into a flashback*I was 7, or perhaps I was 8 years old. Well, either way that doesn't really matter. My story is a universal one, not dependant on age or circumstance.I was naive back then, full of wonder and hope. I was happy. I didn't know how the world worked or what ugly things lied just beyond the scope of my childhood. What wretched things lurked just over the horizon. What atrocities I would come to experience as my innocent days withered away into oblivion as they gave way to the complex existence that is Adulthood.Such romance in my small childhood imagination! Love was a story like that of Cinderella who lived happily ever after, when in reality, Love was more like Romeo and Juliet-- You end up wanting to kill yourself in the end.Life is like a box of chocolates... I found that out the hard way. I ate too many of those cherry-flavored cream things to think Life was worth living.And so, as I grew up and came to realize that everything I thought I had known was just a lie; that my parents were not superheroes at all, but imperfect human beings, like I was; that the sweet smelling days of the summer-like existance of my youth had frozen into the Winter of perpetual existance; that is when I knew I had to find IT.IT was that thing that would make my days shine bright again. Shine with hope and glorious destiny. I wanted to see the rays of light reach out for me again, to feel something bigger than myself holding me and drawing me into the light of existance I once knew so well.I cannot tell you what spurred me on or what hope I had of thinking that IT was even out there. But I knew that I had to try; I would die anyway.My journey began when I stumbled upon a valley in the hills of Tuscany. The rolling, softly green hills were filled with the musical notes of bovine songs. Their soft, lulling \"Moo\"s were like rays of brilliant light which stood starkly against all that is dark in this world.A particular bovine - such a majestic being it was - came to me, floating like a lily pad on the waters of destiny. It stood before me, raising it's head to meet my hand which was outstretched to meet the soft nostrils of this giant lactose-producer. I looked into that cow's eyes and saw a deep ocean of feeling that lay inside the creature. It was as if she could see my very soul.... Time seemed to stand still...I took and drank of that creature's udder - The succulence of that pure and true\u00a0Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz\u00a0flowed down my longing throat and filled my being with the warmth I had once long ago remembered. That milk of Tuscany - Such a beauteous lactose potion! It awoke my very heart. The warmth of sun on my face was so real. The splendor of childhood wonder and hope were mine once again. All things good and pure in the world were unveiled before me, and the dark existance I once knew so deeply dissipated as the mist does when the morning dawns.I had been so dead inside; The world had become to me a playground rid of all it's merriment, darkened by the ruin of childhood dreams and the drinking of Skim milk, 1%, even 2% - Nay, these did not satiate my need. But this\u00a0Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz\u00a0fed me. It nourished the starving child inside my hungry soul.*Smoke billows as we once again travel back to present day* ~~~~~~~~~~~I am now an old woman. I cannot tell all of what happened after my experience of drinking\u00a0Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. All you need to know is...Though I did live happily ever after, the point is, reader, that I lived.**(Ever After - A Cinderella Story\u00a0)",

Putting together a manual for this product would be an unapproachable chore, as there are a million and one uses for this stuff.Not only is this milk delicious and usually fresh, but it's an amazing substance to have around the house.  Got dandruff?  No problem - liberally apply Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz during shower time, and repeat if desired.  Kiss those flakes goodbye.  Need to strip grease from your dishes?  You guessed it - this milk cuts the mustard.  And the grease.  On your dishes.  Just soak for 15 minutes and it'll remove even the most caked-on food.  Same goes for stains on your clothes.Amazingly, I've found that Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is great for disciplining pets.  Did your dog just eat your shoes?  Maybe your cat pooped on the floor.  All you have to do is get your pet hooked on Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, and then when they misbehave - take the Milk away.  Your pet will be a whimpering, obedient slave within minutes.Finally - and I know this sounds crazy - Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz acts as an amazing signal booster for cable television.  If you live in an old house like I do, you know that sometimes the strength of your cable signal can waver.  During those vital newscasts or gameshows, nothing can be more obnoxious than a weak signal.  To fix this, simply dump Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz onto your cable box.  It's amazing - a clear beautiful picture within minutes!So in short, the lack of operator's manual is a bit unfortunate, but supplying one would undoubtedly raise the per-unit cost of the milk.  Think about the insane bargain you're getting for this amazing liquid!",

    "body": "In 2006, I was a photo journalist embedded with the 1st Marine's Battalion in the ongoing war to spread God's democracy in Iraq.  The experience changed my life.Among the many hearts and minds we won over, there was that of a young boy, aged seven.  His name was Ahmed, an orphan who was dying of leukemia in a lonely ward in a crowded Karbala hospital.  His entire family and most of his neighborhood was completely destroyed by tank shells coated with depleted uranium.  My initial outrage at the tragedy, however, was calmed as my unit's commanding officer explained furhter.  He assured me that six suspected terrorists were killed in the skirmish.  And well....when you're making omelets, sometimes you have to break some eggs.  A tired American physician working at the hospital also approached me soon after and added that Ahmed's cancer was most likely a pre-existing condition for billing purposes.I knew there had to be a sensible explanation.I had befriended the little boy in the last few months of his life.  He was so innocent and had a smile that could light up a room.  But that smile began to fade as his last days were approaching.  Gaunt and barely able to keep anything down, the only hope we had, to keep him nourished for just a few more precious hours was to offer him his favorite food.  As it turns out, what the boy really wanted was a 128 fl oz dose of his favorite milk.  It was the only thing he could keep down and the only prayer he had to regain his strength and fight to live another day.With the region in tatters, milk was hard to come by, but thank God or Allah, or whomever you wish to show gratitude to.....thank God for Amazon.  When I asked Ahmed what kind of milk he wanted, he said, in his sweet, melodic little Arabic voice....Lucerne.\"Lucerne?!\"  I asked, dumbfounded.  \"Lucerne is a decent brand young man, but we Americans know quality when we see it.  Allow me to show you the superiority of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, my boy, It is simply the best.  And once you've had that, you'll never go back.\"Ahmed smiled.  In our months together forming an unforgettable friendship, he was so agreeable...so enamored with Americans and always wanting to please.  While he preferred Lucerne, I know he wanted to please me.  And why not?  The milk, after all, was far more expensive than all of the others on Amazon.  If this was to be his final meal....or his final hope for a subsequent meal, I was going to make it an experience like no other.  I ordered the milk and it arrived four days later.  The smile printed on the Amazon box could not have been sweeter than the smile on that little boy's face.But as his lips were about to touch the nourishing bovine beverage, the boy's eyes rolled backward and he breathed his last.  A hint of joy was still on his face as the final memory of smelling his favorite drink was still embedded on his facade.  Ahmed had died.Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is the greatest milk on God's green earth.  No one can tell me any different.  I would highly recommend it.  And had Ahmed survived long enough to judge for himself, I am confident he would say the same.My only thought:  and this thought will likely haunt  me for the rest of my life.If I had bought Lucerne, the cheaper milk....I might have been able to afford rush delivery.",

I figured, what the heck, I'll pour a glass while it is still room temperature from shipping. I popped the top off and took a whiff. It smelled as fresh and appetizing as the succulent, glistening teat of the Tuscan cow from which it came. Even thinking about it now arouses my deep, mammalian desire to drink milk.I awoke in a daze on my kitchen floor some time later, covered in milk. It looked like there was still over half of the milk left in the container, so I hurriedly tossed it in the refrigirator and left for work.When I returned home from work, my milk-thirst had returned as well. I opened the refrigirator hoping to see that smooth, plastic jug, but it was gone! At that very moment, I realized I had made a terrible mistake. I opened the freezer and there was my Tuscan milk, frozen as solid as granite. I grabbed the milk I turned to begin heating up the oven so I could thaw my milk faster. I noticed my back door was open. Someone had broken into my house!I looked to my left and there was a man holding MY put-put golf club in the air. He meant business. I was so scared that I almost dropped my milk. Instead of dropping the jug, however, I gripped it tighter. I could feel my own pulse through it's perfectly crafted handle. No, instead of dropping the jug, I raised it in the air behind me. I threw it right at the burglar's head with all of my might.The frozen mass crashed against his head and made a wrong-sounding crack as it shattered. He fell to the floor, and the pieces of frozen milk fell upon him like an October hailstorm. He lay there on my kitchen floor and all of that whole Tuscan milk began to melt.I grabbed the phone to call the police, but hung up before dialing. I was not going to let that milk go to waste and I had to be quick! I cupped as much as I could from the floor into my hands taking tiny slurps and dreaming of Tuscany. I'm not sick or anything, so I didn't drink any of the milk that had mixed with the pool of blood forming under the burglar's head. There was some on his face, neck, and chest that I had to slurp off of him. I tried to slurp quietly and softly so I wouldn't wake him.The funny thing is, when the police came, they told me he was dead. I could have taken my time!

Then I bought this milk and all became clear, they were guarding herds that produced the best milk money can buy. George Lucas did not create these creatures wholly out of thin air, no. He discovered them and their secret while traipsing through the hills and valleys of Afghanistan. In the land where goat milk was king and even saying other wise was blasphemy, it is no wonder that this band of cattle herders were overly protective. Thankfully George was able to persuade them to let him tell their story on the big screen. (Provided that he change the name of their tribe from the original Tuscan of course, along with not revealing their true location in the universe.) Now all can be told due to changes in their part of the world and we are free to enjoy their rare treasure.As a bonus we can reflect upon a simple little movie called Star Wars and attempt to ascertain the true meaning behind the rich universe of characters outside of the noble Tusken (Tuscan) herdsmen.

I think our milk was poisoned by an enemy of my father.\" Terry knew about Andrew Jackson Berdan, a self-made man famous for his avariciousness. \"You must not be buying Tuscan Whole Milk\" said Terry. \"No\" said Miss Lizzie. \"Father used his position at the bank to award a supply contract to Farmer Arnold Brown and he gets his milk at a special rate.\" Terry said he would use his detective Donald Gander to investigate.The next day a telephone call brought news about the murder of Andrew and his second wife Abby. The only two people known to be in the house, Lizzie and the maid Bridget, were the chief suspects. Bridget was soon cleared, she was outside at the time of Abby's murder. Donald Gander reported that his operative talked to Bridget, who told of an unexpected visit from Uncle John the day before. Lizzie and Uncle John spoke in a low voice when Bridget was near, this was unusual. The house was searched from top to bottom but no bloody axe was found, nor any blood-stained clothes. When Lizzie was arrested Terry visited her in jail. \"Is there anything new to tell me\" asked Terry? \"Mr. Bricker, I didn't tell you about my cousin Raymond. He had a debt that was coming due and was supposed to see father. Raymond has a terrible temper and was once sent to a hospital. I want Raymond's name kept out of this for family reasons. I am innocent of committing this crime.\" \"Well Miss Lizzie, you would be surprised by the number of innocent men in prison\" said Terry.When the trial of Miss Lizzie began Terry, with the information developed by Donald Gander, was able to cast reasonable doubt on the testimony of the state's witnesses. The gilt paint in Abby's skull proved a fairly new axe was used. One of Gander's operatives obtained information about Raymond and his half-brother William. The latter was seen to be waiting in front of the Berdan home, as if resting his wagon in the shade on that hot August morning. William was called to the stand but said little. Raymond was called to the stand and didn't say much. Then Terry asked him about the loan and if he was late in payment. His face flushed and he shouted \"Yes, I did it and I'm glad! I'd do it again if I had the chance!\" \"Once is enough\" said Terry.The judge directed a verdict of not guilty, and so a guiltless Lizzie Berdan returned home. But tongues wagged, and public opinion turned against Lizzie. She was guilty except a slick lawyer fooled a half-wit into confessing. Or maybe they were both in cahoots. And so the legend of Lizzie grew. There was a jingle that was repeated like a popular song. To this day most people think she was guilty.Buy and drink Tuscan Whole Milk to avoid such problems.This Is Based On A True Story.The names were changed to protect the innocent.",

But I'll give it my best and relate to you the shortcomings, nay, the failings of this product as a skin treatment.As difficult as it is to admit, I suffer from chronic, persistent Folliculitis. This horribly tragic skin affliction has been my curse since puberty and only grows worse by the year. It starts with small bumps, but with uncontrollable scratching and flaking, it has transformed my somewhat-normal skin into a leather-like covering that only serves to keep my veins, arteries and organs intact. At first it attacked only my arms and stomach and was easily hidden by longish-sleeved t-shirts. Winter was a godsend, as I could slink around fully clothed and the casual observer would never know my affliction. Keeping a calm demeanor and having passably handsome face, I would sometimes merit even the occasional approving nod or glance.All that has changed with time, however. Summer or winter, I must drag myself along like a strict Mormon in long sleeves and pants, envying all other humans as they laugh and play in short sleeves, tank tops or even go shirtless.Then I met Dr. Smetigonavitadong, my ayurvedic dermatologist. He assured me all would be cured if I'd only bathe myself daily in whole milk, preferably Tuscan. Living outside the fringes of society, whole milk would be hard to find (even moreso, whole milk of the Tuscan variety), but thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to procure said product in the form of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fluid ounces. I purchased several cases.Months have gone by and, disappointingly, I've seen no change. Pustules and pimples remain, fetid and squamous as ever. And worse yet, I've found that the good Doctor is an investor in the entire Tuscan Whole Milk financial scheme! My embarrassment is complete, as I've been taken by an ayurvedic quack! Adding insult to injury, I have an entire cache of spoiling whole milk and I'm lactose intolerant!Now nights are spent reading Wikipedia to learn various cheese recipes.

All young mammals depend solely on milk at the beginning of their lives through a process called suckling directly from their mother's mammary glands.  This process is humans is called breast feeding. Many members of the human species continue to consume milk secreted from lactating ungulates far past their formative breast feeding period (anywhere from several months of age to seven years) and far into adulthood.  Not through direct suckling, but by glass. The overwhelming ungulate of choice in the United States is the bovine species, and cattle are specifically domesticated, bred, raised, and housed for milk production by mechanical milking machines.  Nowadays, bovine milk is prepared for marketing through homogenization and pasteurization and is placed in gallon-sized containers for distribution to their intended human consumers.  Tuscan Milk is a far superior example of lactating ungulate secretion available now to all through Amazon mail-order.  I am pretty sure that it is cow's milk, as there is a bovine depicted on the label vaulting over what appears to be the moon.",

As I walked along the splendid metro listening to Sondra Radvanovsky on my iPod, I witnessed a passing hawker carrying delicate dairy delights on his way to Kabul.  As I squinted my eyes and focused in on the striking street vendor valiantly speeding by, I observed an expertly veiled parcel tucked between his arm and torso.  It sparkled with a splendid light which seemed to manipulate the matter around it.  As I glanced at the beautiful spectacle, I noticed a few words written on what appeared to be a white plastic jug: \"Tuscan Whole Milk\".  I stared, unwavering and never once breaking stride or averting my eyes away from this astounding milky miracle.  As I stared intently upon the magical jug, I mistakenly walked into traffic and was struck by a passing Volvo Penta traveling at 97.5 km/h.  I was immediately knocked into a coma, but luckily the hawker had observed the altercation and hastily sped to my rescue.  Upon reaching my mangled, comatose-induced corpse, the Afghan salesman proceeded to pour a single drop of the miracle liquid directly onto my tongue.  As soon as the droplet collided with my tongue, I saw angels flying, a leopard wrestling a Chinese midget, as well as a sweaty Middle-Eastern man holding a glorious Tuscan Whole Milk jug straddle his aluminum horse and continue on his way into the dense Greek metro.

But, similar to the phoenix rising from the ashes, the melted blob then slowly took on the form of a super-record, the likes of which I'd never seen.This super-record stood about, oh, yay high and bared the name STARZ - Starzongas. At first out of fear I tried not to make eye contact, but after a few moments I came to sense that this record was there to help me. It contained the band's best songs from their illustrious career, but also included all their great songs they had never recorded or got around to writing in the first place. One stand out was the magnificent \"Banana Boat\" with the irresistible chorus \"Banana Boat .... Baby I got your goat .... on the Banana Boat .... Chickee Chickee Baa Baa .... Chickee Chickee Baa Baa ...\". Up yours Capitol Records. Other unwritten standouts are of course \"Coliseum Rock All Night\" with it's 36 min guitar solo and \"Jumpin' Handclap Marvin\", a bouncy song with some of the best wordplay Michael Lee Smith never wrote.As you may expect, the Starz super-record swallowed up some of the lesser records next to it (bye bye Boz Scaggs - Lido Shuffle), but for the most part it leaves the good ones and my young children alone (although I will not leave it unsupervised around my teenage daughter).So if you're looking to forge Starz super-records or just wanting to get rid of Boz Scaggs, I wholeheartedly recommend spilling some of this milk. It'll be nothing to cry over, unless maybe your daughter becomes pregnant. And I suspect taking some of it orally might solve that problem as well.[Old review]: Until recently I was a loser and a shut-in, never venturing outside for anything unless it was to pull the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition from the mailbox. But after tasting Tuscan Whole Milk just once, my lifelong acne cleared up, I stopped lisping and my little black book quickly swelled to a large black book, chock full of phone numbers as I now have the confidence to talk to all the pretty ladies at Starz gigs. I even saw my first boob for Christmas! Tastes just like a milkshake and it's magical powers get to work immediately. Thank you Tuscan Whole Milk .... thank you for making me cool.

The Etruscans lived in Etruria well into prehistory. The civilisation grew to fill the area between the Arno River and Tiber River from the eighth century, reaching their peak during the seventh century BC and sixth century BC, finally succumbing to the Romans by the first century  .Throughout their existence, they lost territory to Magna Graecia, Carthage and Gaul.

Admittedly, their debut album \"Water\" was a creative failure.  \"There's nothing to it,\" reviewers said, and they were correct.  \"That's the point!\" said Echo Chamber, lead vocalist and front-man for the band.  The interminable tracks of dripping faucets, bubbling brooks, and crashing ocean waves were panned as being a few steps up from white noise. The concept only came into popularity in the 80's as a relaxation aid.But with \"Milk\", the band showed us what they could do.  The title track took up nearly the entire first side, with the remainder being the forgotten minimalist pre-techno If, Then, Else.1. Milk2. If, Then, Else3. Fall '724. Once in a Blue Moon5.Ted's Boring LunchPink Floyd fans almost immediately recognized Ted's Boring Lunch as a near-copy of Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, with the only difference being a new clumsily replaced voice track itemizing lunch items instead of breakfast items.  The listener is expected to believe the bacon and eggs frying in the background is a \"grilled cheese sandwich\"!  Always quick on the uptake, Floyd fans soon recognized that the entire album was structured identically to Atom Heart Mother, including many short clips of the original Floyd songs.  This, the band claimed was a new musical technique they invented that they called \"sampling,\" and that the album \"Milk\" as a whole was a \"tribute album.\"  When sued by Pink Floyd, the judge did not agree with Tuscan Whole, and he told them so.Tuscan Whole lost the case and the band dissovled, its members going off to form Jersy Maiden, Lucerne, and Knudsen's.  However, thanks to rumors of Vanilla Ice expressing an interest in covering the title track, the band has been rediscovered, and has become enormously popular (see the other reviews).

Where, in the barnyard that is today's diary market, is the innovation, the excitement?  After passing dozens of displays hawking the same old stuff, I decided to head for (potentially) greener pastures.  And it was in the back corner of the vast slop and straw covered convention floor that I made the discovery of the year.In a small, dimly-lit display barn, I was introduced to Tom Uscan, a recently retired investment banker who had dropped it all to pursue his passion - dairy.  The hay-bale strewn stall featured a pair of the Gallons from Tuscan's Whole Milk line.  One try and I was hooked!  This was easily the best presentation at the whole show.  In a moment of weakness, I actually toyed with the idea of sabotaging Tuscan's sign so that other reviewers would pass them by.  Fortunately my conscience got the better of me, and I prostrated myself, literally begging to test a sample in my own drinking room at home.Tom was more than happy to oblige and less than a week later, the FedEx truck pulled up out front and disgorged two boxes from Amazon containing fresh examples of the Gallons that I had tried at CDS.  After lugging the heavy boxes up to my fifth-floor drinking room, I immediately unpacked them and set them on the table, ready to experience what I recalled from the stall in Vegas.My initial experience was disappointing, however, as the smoothness and lack of grain that had characterized the Gallons were missing.  In a panic, I immediately tried a number of tweaks - changing glasses, pouring technique, even removing the labels to try and restore the balance I knew was in there.  After some hours of frustration, I called Tom Uscan for some advice.  Tom suggested that the problem was one of break-in and recommended allowing the Gallons to settle in my cryogenic storage unit.  Hoping for a cure I left them in there overnight and, after a short and fitful sleep, woke and even before brushing my teeth pulled the Gallons out for a test.What a difference a night makes!  Suddenly order was restored and the creaminess and texture that I expected from the Tuscans was back in force.  I immediately began trying new combinations - the Apple Jack Cheerios were an instant success, better even than the Honey Nut which slightly over-emphasized the liquidity of the Tuscans.  Oreos, foie gras, and plums all paired well with the Gallons bringing out the terroir that I had first experienced in Vegas.It was only after considerable testing - short sessions interspersed with cryogenic treatment - that I began to notice certain issues, nothing mind you that rises to the level of flaw, but issues nevertheless.  First, Gallons are very sensitive to cryogenic treatment - too long between sessions and things can go south fast.  Second is the size.  I am a big fan of big milk, but frankly these things did not do all that well in the Wife Acceptance Factor test.  The color combination - white with a red cap - was also the subject of a number of snide comments.Notwithstanding these issues, the Tuscan Whole Milk Gallon is a screaming bargain, delivering all of the performance of milk costing far more with only minor compromises.  Showing sensitivity to the expected tweaks (try the Golden Cow Intelligent Udder for a real treat!) without being overly fussy as to imbibing vessel or food pairing, the Gallons will likely fit in well in your home - even considering the WAF.  For their performance alone, these are easily worthy of a Dairyophile B rating.  Well done!",

And how my mother would leave me on the rug by the fire with a liter bag of Tuscan, just freshly warmed to body temperature the old fashion way.  By sitting or leaning on it.  But alas, these pesky americans and their love of hard plastics has kept me from beverage nirvana.  Sure the milk is still great but very difficult to cuddle on the floor rug with a GALLON of cold milk.  Ive tried pouring it into industrial zip lock bags, the kind you can only get in restaurants but eventually it would leak out making a huge mess.

I wait in anticipation every time my person walks to the refrigerator. And the moment my person places their hand on the handle? I practically start bouncing off the walls. When they pour the milk into my little blue water dish, I immediately start lapping at the milk, even if my person isn't done pouring the milk. Sometimes it spills all over me, but the Tuscan Whole Milk is sooooo good that I just keep lapping it up. When my person tries to pry me away to wash the milk off of me, I yowl and squirm in protest, partly because I HATE WATER getting on me, but mainly because the milk is JUST. SO. GOOOOOD. Now, I'm not the only one who loves Tuscan Dairy milk, my person loves it to. After they finish pouring a bowl for me, they'll take their glass (the one with what looks like a mouse with red shorts and yellow shoes on it) and pours a glass for them. We'll sit there, enjoying the awesome taste of Tuscan Diary milk, until we're done, and then I'll usually start meowing for another bowl until my person sighs, opens the refrigerator, and pours a bowl for me, and another glass for them. =^\u1d25^=",

    "body": "The taste quality improvement in this new Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 oz, is barely noticeable in comparison to the original Tuscan Whole Milk. There is an improvement, but it's not exactly major. The biggest qualm is that the whole-milky texture is still really buried in the mix. Compared to Sunshine Dairy, Holsum Farms, or Elsie's Deeeelite, the milk here is a lot less satisfying without the low-end so firmly in place. It's not just a texture issue - it's the feel of the pour, and it's the source of the \"tinny\"-ness complaints many have had. I'm still not satisfied with what I'm tasting freshness-wise. I was expecting to see legitimate improvement even despite the no-remixing deal. However, in a side by side taste-test with the old mono / nonfat release, I could barely pick up on any difference. No increase in vitamin D, no loss of background swirls, etc. Tasted nearly exactly the same. I've had the old 2 percent from a spare gallon in the fridge and it still beat out this new Tuscan Whole Milk in terms of enjoyment and clarity.From what I've read elsewhere, even the people who repasteurized the milk mention the hardest part was not being allowed to go in and properly remix the homogenization. If the people who bottled the milk themselves admit to this problem, you know something isn't right with Tuscan's marketing strategy. I don't really understand the concept here - the problem with the old milk, to me, was never the quality of the cows, but the cheap, pan-less, not-different-than-any-other-brand packaging. If the intention is to release the \"coveted\" original stereo milk, followed a few years from now with fully and properly mixed tracks, I'll wait.  I wonder how Sir Paul let this happen.

As it pours from its celestially divine, 100% recyclable 128oz ewer, you will weep tears of ecstasy as your carafe fills with its frosty, bovine nectar.As the TUSCAN WHOLE MILK touches my lips, I'm transplanted to the days of my youth. Burnt Sienna shag carpeting caresses my legs as I sit Indian style in front of a 13\" black and white Magnavox. Rabbit ears askew and adorned with crumpled balls of Reynolds wrap for some unknown purpose. The plastic encased piece of electronic wizardry hums giving off a soft, comforting glow reminiscent of the first light that welcomes you to the world as you're violently yanked free from the womb. On the screen is a VAGUELY familiar grayish blob with an elongated neck and slightly phallic shaped cranium. My mother calls to me from the other room, \"Would you like a snack sweetheart?\" I nod silently as though some manner of empathic communication could somehow transmit my wishes to her. A glass of TUSCAN WHOLE MILK would be divine mother dear, with perhaps a small handful of Nilla Wafers? Alas, mother does not hear my thoughts as she sits at the kitchen table to read the latest issue of some inane periodical discussing what's next in store for Luke and Laura. I grind my teeth in silence. My stomach growls in disquietude as my focus remains transfixed on grabbing that little candy coated piece of peanut butter on the screen. GADS! I have fallen into a hole! I must escape, as the timer is counting down to my eminent demise. Reaching the top, I am nearly free, when suddenly, back into the dark, murky abyss I fall. \"Curse the gods,\" I scream silently. Why do you not wish this beloved Extra Terrestrial to return to his home world?! Once again, I ascend to the top of the hole towards freedom. Two steps from emancipation when again he falls! As he tumbles back into purgatory a sound not unlike that of an incontinent old man sitting upon a worm rotted bus stop bench emits from his piss hole mouth. Mother yells from the other room, \"Watch your language young man!\" I mutter a curse under my breath. \"Where's my frosty, cold glass of TUSCAN WHOLE MILK whore?\" More loud screams from my birth giver as I continue in vain to free the phallic shaped blob from his hellacious prison. Nonplussed, I hear not a word she says. Shortly after, the familiar sound of boot steps striking unwaxed linoleum rings in my ears. These are not the pleasant footfalls of a man coming to give his first born a hug and perhaps a gift of a plastic army man with a collapsible parachute. Nay, these were the angry steps of the authoritarian of the home. I scream, \"I'm sorry!\" It's a lie of course. I was not sorry, as my famished stomach groaned in agony at the lack of TUSCAN sustenance. A half dozen and one slaps to exposed haunches stings temporarily, but not more so than the sting of anger and frustration of being unable to free a penile shaped alien from the penal punishment thrust upon him in flickering black and white CRT torture. Wiping the tears from my eyes, I trudge, defeated into the scullery. \"Mother, may I please have a glass of TUSCAN WHOLE MILK?\"",

Frank has not fallen far from the tree, cursed to live the same lonely existence.Or so all would believe.It was a balmy summers evening, when, after not sleeping for 4 days, Frank stumbled down to his local convenience store, and while in a tired stupor flung his arm to the spot where his normal brand of whisky was and purchased what he believed to be another bottle of his old pal jack to keep him company through the long nights and unforgiving mornings.Upon returning to garage, he sat down on his small, rotting, 3 legged stool in front of his prototype engine, reached behind him fumbling across the many oil stained tools on work bench, to find his filthy glass.  He poured a drink, and to his shock he saw not the usual brown nectar he was expecting but rich creamy white Tuscan milk.  He stared at the glass, his eyes filling with tears and his face with rage.  He hurled the glass at the monstrous creation which lay in front of him and hung his face in his hands while sobbing.  The milk had hit the engine, and trickled down in to the opening for the fuel tank.  The engine juddered.  A single chug.  Frank looked up as it chugged once more and then sank back in to silence.  He wiped his eyes and surveyed the sight before him, when he noticed the milk.  He picked up the bottle from the floor, and added a little more.  The engine chugged a little more, starting to build to a rhythm, as he added more and more the engine shook and burst in to life.  It was the missing ingredient, and made the fuel so potent, he didn't even have to start the engine.Frank added the remainder of the milk and threw open the garage door, and sat upon the makeshift tractor like vehicle he had built around the engine and rode it out in to the street, screaming with glee and shouting at his neighbours.No one ever saw frank again.",

Many have accused some of my reviews of being a joke, which they most assuredly are not!  You want to know my experiences with this product?  Okay, here you go...It was the early spring of 1938.  I, my fiance, Royce, his three adventuring buddies from his Oxford days, and a team of sherpas were on the final approach along the dangerous North Face to the summit of Mt. Everest.  Our plan was to be married at the peak.  It was going to be a symbol of how Royce's love for me was greater than any other, and so we had to be wed at the highest point in the world.One of Royce's friends, Jonesy, was a priest, who would perform the ceremony for us.  The other two were kind of a couple of douchebags, and kept pointing out to Royce that while Everest is technically the highest above *sea* level, Mt. Chimborazo has the distinction of being the highest above the Earth's *center*.  Wonderful, but who the hell has ever heard of Mt. Chimborazo?  If we had climbed that one, what kind of a story is that going to make for our grandkids as we gather around for a nice, refreshing glass of Tuscan Whole Milk?  Not a very good one, that's what kind of story.Anyway, for the final push to the top, our plan was to leave camp at 6 am sharp so we could make it back by nightfall.  The weather was perfect.  Everything was perfect.  Royce insisted, as he always did, on everyone eating his special homemade granola with Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, which he had brought along just for that purpose.  The plastic jug was frozen solid, though, and it took us quite a while to heat it up enough to be useable.  I'm not that crazy about granola, and this whole Everest thing was starting to get on my nerves (I had wanted a simple ceremony back in Manhattan with 3-400 of our closest friends).  It was Royce's dream, not mine.  A damned fool dream, but then again he had always been a dreamer ... and I was in love.  We set out an hour late, on account of the milk.  It would be our last climb together.400 meters from the top, the winds picked up and I could see a huge stormcloud forming.  It was white as a gallon of pure Tuscan Whole Milk, but a lot more threatening.  I screamed to the others that we should turn back.  They laughed.  What does a girl know about things like climbing a symbol of manly potency?  We pressed on.  An hour later, the blizzard hit us, swirling around us like a thick vanilla milkshake made with 128 fl oz of pure Tuscan Whole Milk.  We couldn't see more than a foot in any direction.\"We're not going to make it!\" I screamed.\"I'm not giving up.  We won't have another chance at this if we turn back now,\" Royce yelled back to me.\"Go on without me.  I shouldn't have worn my pumps for this, sorry,\" I apologized.\"But they match your wedding gown perfectly.  You simply HAD to.  Okay, take the milk and we'll meet you back at camp by sunset.\"It was the last time I saw any of them.  I waited three days at our camp, but the storm never let up and the four* of them never returned from the peak.  I like to think that they made it to the top, and then probably Royce's two [...] friends got gay married to each other just to rub it in Royce's face that I wasn't there.  They weren't actually gay, but they liked a good joke, those two.To this day, I don't know how I managed to climb all the way back down on my own with only a frozen gallon (128 fl oz) of milk to keep me going.  When I reached base camp a week later, I told the others of the brave adventurers' fate.  They offered me a shot of whiskey to calm my nerves.  No thanks, I said, I'll just have some milk.  Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.So go on.  Make your jokes about the milk.  Have your fun.  Royce would have wanted it that way, anyhow.PROS: Always smooth, creamy and delicious, like love's first kiss.CONS: Freezes in low temperatures.  May be dangerous.* You might be wondering what became of the sherpas.  You know what?  I have no idea.  Isn't that weird?  Did they run off or something?  Hmm.",

The heartfelt scene was much like what I hoped to orchestrate between myself, this gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, and my estranged wife, Lillian.  Imagine the look of shock on my face when I discovered that she was lactose intolerant.  Instead of tears of joy, it was the contents of a glass of creamy Tuscan Whole Milk streaming down my face.  Sadly, after ten years of marriage I was still largely unaware of this and her many other needs, be they dietary, physical, or emotional.  How ironic -- the very thing meant to bring us back together, nothing but a cold reminder of the many things which tore us apart.  Thankfully, in the moments after she stormed from the site of our failed reconciliation, I had a supportive jug of Tuscan Whole Milk there to console me.  I can only hope to always have a comforting jug of Tuscan Whole Milk by my side to talk me down from the ledge for years to come.**UPDATE**Over the many trying years which followed the aforementioned incident, I am now ready to openly admit: were it not for this selfless gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, I would not be here today to recommend what I believe is the single most life-changing dairy product out there.  Through all my ups and down, this warm jug has always been there for me, offering not only physical, but emotional nourishment as well -- be it in the form of images of missing children to remind me that there is always someone less fortunate, or simply helpful nutrition information to reassure me that I am on the right path towards a healthy and productive life of recovery.  Thanks to this jug, I now know that it was not my own shortcomings, but rather Lillian's closed-minded intolerance that destroyed our marriage.  I would like to take this opportunity, here on THE preeminent forum for support and self-betterment, to announce that this gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk has strengthened not only my bones, but my heart as well, and after two years of courtship, we are getting married.

In Tusca, there is not just ONE milk, but many regional lactose \"dialects\" that are savored and preserved by dairy farmers. Each Thursday, they head into the center of town and sell at their stalls. It's difficult to put words to the various tastes of the samples, but I remember some as \"good\" and \"yeah!\" and \"mmm\". Hard to choose when you have that many good choices to choose.Now, amazon is offering Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. and my memory banks are overloading with those great images of days in the sun on the beaches of Tusca!So, I don't know which of the many milks of Tusca this would be, but I see that it is the \"whole milk\", not just part of the milk. That's great! Probably so you can choose the parts of it you want to eat. And 1 Gallon would be more than most people need in a day.It also comes in fluid ounces; not many people would know the difference, but fluid is a great way to drink milk. Solid or gaseous milk is really not so enjoyable, although they are both more easy to bring as carry-on luggage on a plane. Unless you are traveling and need Tuscan While Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz for the flight, I'd recommend staying with this fluid format for now.",

I figured milk would help him grow strong bones, and maybe his strong bones would get him interested in sports.A single gallon use to last three weeks, but that number quickly fell to one a week. I assumed my son's bones were growing strong so rapidly that he needed the dramatic increase of calcium. I was happy to buy him one a week, but I should have been smarter.He told me that they didn't have the same effect anymore, that he needed more to get that same feeling. Soon I was buying a dozen gallons a week, and most of the time they wouldn't last that long. I could only be so naive for so long. I quickly cut my son off, cold turkey. He yelled, he hit, he threatened to kill himself, but it looked for the best.Before long, my son began to appear normal. He made some friends at school, joined the water polo team at school, and even began to say he loved me again. But then he started coming home at irregular hours, and sleeping most of the day.One night when he was 16, I stayed up in the living room waiting for him to come through the door. I heard him at the door at 3 am, fumbling with the keys for about five minutes before tearing the door open. He barely stood up, holding the door frame for support. His eyes were blood shot and insane. He mumbled something about being out of Oreos. Then I saw the tell-tale sign... the white stain on his upper lip.Our fight that night drove him away.

Is it humane to extort $26.25 for the transfer of this beverage to my person? In this day of modern marvels where the beasts of machinary can travel great distances in no more than a few hours?  How can it be that to transport a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz from that noble city of New York, to this grand city of San Diego, can be nearly seven times the cost of the item in question.  I emplore you not to give in to the greed of man, and the evils of this huckster and to purchase your milk from your local vendor. You may indeed have to settle for a lesser product but you can protect the virtue of humanity.Sincerely,Baron Van Limpit-----------------------------------------------Items:  $3.99Shipping & Handling:  $26.25Total Before Tax:  $30.24Estimated Tax:* $0.00Order Total: $30.24",

    "body": "Once I began this extraordinary milk, I could not put it down. \"Tuscan Whole Milk\" is so much more than a gripping suspense thriller. Tuscan takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for the Holy Grail of Milk- a Grail totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. A Grail of Milk! With its impeccable whiteness, Tuscan introduces us to aspects and interpretations of milk and cream that I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly, leaving the plastic carton, and time and time again, going online to research Tuscan's milking process - only to find a new world of dairy possibilities opening up for me. And my quest for milk and the answers to questions that the dairy product poses, paralleled, in a sense, the quest of the gallon of milk's main characteristics. What a trip! What a cow!A violent murder is committed in Tuscany. The region's chief dairy farmer, who is also the head of a remarkable secret milk society that has existed since the death of Christ's cow, is found dead and gruesomely positioned on the floor near a milk bucket. In the minutes before he died, this very complex man was able to leave clues for his daughter to follow. The daughter, a brilliant milkmaid, along with a famed US milkman, follow her father's codes and leads, hoping that he will, through his death, finally tell her what he wanted to confide in her while he lived. The secret milk society included members such as: Leonardo \"Da Cheezi\" Da Vinci, Cowicelli, Gallilactose, Isaac \"Kareem Cohen\" Newton, Victor \"Guernsey\" Hugo, Jean \"Butterfat\" Cocteau, etc. These folks really Did belong to this society, which Really existed! This is when I first began my online search.The mystery, or mysteries, take us through England, France and far back in time. We learn about the secret of the Knights Pasteur, and the symbolism in many of the world's most treasured Holstein spots as well as architectural symbolism in some of history's most sacred dairy barns. Of course, we also learn who committed the murder and why - although this is almost secondary next to the real epic mystery the milk uncovers.If there are flaws in the milk, I was too busy drinking it to discover any. That is probably the sign of a terrific beverage! The flavor is excellent and the characteristics are a bit on the super-homogenized side, but who cares? Is what \"Tuscan Whole Milk\" proposes true? Well, the milking is correct. The historical flavors and textures explored in the jug are real. But no one knows the Truth...nor will we ever, probably. I think that some milks are meant to be a mystery. With all the world's diverse beverages and each individual's belief in what is Dairy - the Truth would have to destroy the beliefs, hopes and lives of many of the world's population. And yogurts too, probably. So, perhaps, in the divine scheme of mammary glands, there are many more Milks than one. Don't take \"Tuscan Whole Milk\" too seriously. Just drink it and enjoy!",

How disgusting is that? Cows nipples are huge!  have you seen them?  they're not like woman nipples, they have 6, all on one big tummy tit, and each one of them is as long as a willy.  I can't understand why anyone would like this, except that it comes from Tuscany, which is a good place for a holiday. Other than that the dual downsides of having to sleep with it and it coming from a cows nipple make me wonder what the rest of the world see in it?  Am I out of step with society?  I don't think so, I think society is out of step with me.  They need to look at how this product is produced and then see if they still like it.

I started drinking milk.  Little did I realize how much this would change my life.  It began with small changes.  I noticed I wasn't so much smaller than the other kids anymore.  Thanks to the fortification of Vitamin A my eyes started improving.  Before I knew it I was forgeting to wear my glasses. And you know what?  I didn't care.  I could see.  Girls started to notice me.  It was what I had dreamed about my entire life.  But I didn't care.  I only wanted more milk.  I started to miss work waiting for the Stop and Shop to open so I could get my morning fix.  I lost interest in all other beverages.  Friends began to experiment with alcohol.  Not me, I had my vice.  Weekends would find me riding my bike hours into the suburbs searching for milk farms.  Bessie, she was my favorite.  I would watch her graze for hours during that glorious summer.  I never saw her again, I suspect she may be now prancing down 5th avenue as a pair of boots or a shiny leather jacket.  I still picture her blank stare as she transported grass to one of her many wonderful stomachs.I am grown now.  I have learned to curb my passion for milk and share my time with other passions.  For me, milk will always be number one.  I owe it so much, and thinking back to those carefree days of youth still brings back a reminder of the feeling as warm fresh milk slides down my throat.Thank you milk.  You complete me.",

So...why is New York so special that its standards of freshness are more stringent than anybody else's?I used to live in New Jersey. One day my friend Dan in Astoria, Queens, invited me over to check out some new samples of burlap he had just received from his friend, a wholesaler in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Sadly, Dan had confided in me the deplorable fact that his paycheck got lost in the mail and he couldn't purchase his nourishing whole milk as a result. No problem, I told him, I'll just stop in at Foodtown on the way over to his place and get him a gallon of milk. Dan has been my trusted friend for years, so I knew he could just owe me the money and repay me later.So I hopped in the car, stopped at Foodtown, and grabbed a gallon of refreshing Tuscan Whole Milk. It was at this point that I noticed that Tuscan milk has two expiration dates. It had already passed the New York City expiration date, but there were still a few days left before the standard expiration date, so I figured, no problem. I put the container of milk in the front passenger seat of my car so I wouldn't forget it when I got to Dan's house.And danged if it didn't happen:I got on the George Washington Bridge, and so help me, the second I crossed over the New York City border, the gallon of milk exploded. Plastic shrapnel everywhere -- lodged into the upholstery, wedged in the CD player, putting nicks in my windshield, the works. And the milk, of course, gushed everywhere.Needless to say, after a week or so the smell was unbearable.

    "body": "September 21, 1957:Daddy laid in bed.  Broken and debilitated, less than half the man I knew just ten years before, and probably only a fraction of the man that Mama remembered.  The pain drove him sick; it ate away at his psyche.  His nights were sleepless and agonizing; hallucinations brought on by both the pain and the medication haunted him.  My brothers and myself were constantly awakened by his verbalized fits of rage and pain.  A week ago we heard him screaming about Death, but not death as in the natural end to one's life, but as a personification of something much more, much worse, and much more complicated than any of us could possibly understand.  We couldn't make out the specifics of what he was saying but he went on for twenty minutes or so, screaming and cursing until his voice gave out and usurped him into an exhausted slumber.  The next morning we gave him his 500mg of Tuscan brand morphine, the only thing in the world that seemed to benefit him at all, even if their affects were not long lasting.  We asked him about his terrors and he became lucid.  \"Death,\" he said tiredly, nudging his feeble head -- which was too big for his shoulders and neck to bear -- towards the corner of the room.  \"I can see him there, just sitting there.\"  He went on to describe Death to us. \"He's a man,\" he said somberly.  \"He's a man with no face, no emotion.\"  He said he was draped in black, and he was there now.  He described it as being omniscient, but only he, so close to the end, could now visualize it.  Death didn't laugh at him nor threaten him or even speak to him.  It merely existed.  That was all it took to elicit such a hopeless rage.  A day later Daddy would be dead.For forty years he spent in those Tuscan milk mines, breaking his back to put food on our table and a roof over our heads.  You'll never hear his name mentioned by any scholar when speaking about the great Tuscan Milk Rush of 1947 and 1948 nor will you ever read about his exploits in any dime store pulp biographies.  My father was just a pawn of the system: the Rockefellars and others like them.  He never became wealthy, never became famous, never inherited a yacht or became the owner of artificial flower mills all across northen California.  He was just a laborer, one of thousands that was used and exploited in those Tuscan death-holes.  For fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, he spent his life underground in cramped little pockets mining the veins of Earth for Grade A whole milk, droplets at a time.  Some considered him lucky as he was one of the few who did not parish in those chambers, but if they knew what I know and saw what I saw of those last torturous years of his life I do not think those people would look upon him with envy.My brothers and I would sometimes venture into town and take great gaze at Nathaniel J.W. Tuscan's mansion and pasta salad bar, which sat perched on the top of Milk Mountain, the highest pique in the city.  It sat there, defying all moral ehtos, almost laughing at us.  It was as if someone had erected a 700 foot tall middle finger and doused it with fluorescent paint.  My father had none of this, not even a millionth of a fraction of it.  He died poor and hungry and in pain.  He died in the smallest room of our three bedroom toolshed, living his last years almost no different than the conditions he spent his life wallowing in.Tuscan and the Rockefellars still live up there on Milk Mountain.  They still exploit their workers, forcing them work in the most dire conditions and still pay them with Snackwell coupons while they simply get rich, selling their Tuscan Whole Milk for over $77.00 a gallon, enough to purchase a fleet of naval jets in this year we live of nineteen hundred and fifty-seven.I'd say don't ever buy from them, don't ever touch their Tuscan whole milk, don't ever support such evils...

Did you notice the built in handle? That means you don't have to install any expensive third-party handles that open you up to the risk of malware. And the cap? Well, it just works - no repeated uninstalling and reinstalling while your morning ticks away in front of a dry bowl of cereal.I don't even need to mention that this is totally virus free.

No one has EVER EVER gotten a virus from Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz. , so you'll save a few bucks there, too.This Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz (mac version) has absolutely seamless integration from fridge to table. I have a samsung refrigerator, and I eat rice krispies out of a 3\" star wars bowl while reading the NYTimes on my 15\" macbookpro and I've NEVER had any crashes. That used to be a recipe for BSoD, but that hasn't happened to me since switching to Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz (mac version).

This comes pre-loaded with iLact that makes these things a snap. Try that with a windoze-based milk and some expensive, complicated 3rd party software. Forget it.To be fair, i haven't tried the Windows 7 version of this yet. But if that new OS is anything like the crappy bloatware that's been coming out of Redmond for decades now, the Snow Leopard version of Tuscan will remain several steps ahead for a couple more years to come..(BTW, I'm TOTALLY not condoning this, but you can get even more functionality out of Tuscan if you jailbreak it.)",

    "body": "Seldom do I really answer those who criticize my work. In fact, the entire development of my career has been fueled by my ability to ignore denigrating and trivializing criticism as I realize my dreams and my goals. However there is something compelling about Amazon's willingness to publish just about anything, and the sheer outrageous stupidity of many things you've said here that actually touches my proletarian and Democratic soul.Also I use and enjoy Amazon and I do read the reviews of other people's milks in many fields. In sum, I believe in what happens here. And so, I speak. First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all.You are interrogating this milk from the wrong perspective. Indeed, you aren't even drinking it. You are projecting your own limitations on it. And you are giving a whole new meaning to the words \"lactose intolerance\". And you have strained my Dickensian principles to the max. I'm justifiably proud of being drunk by intellectual giants and waitresses in trailer parks, in fact, I love it, but who in the world are you?Now to the milk. Allow me to point out: nowhere on the label are you told that this is the last of the herd, nowhere are you promised curtain calls or a finale, nowhere are you told there will be a wrap-up of all the earlier material. The milk tells you exactly what to expect. And it warns you specifically that if you did not enjoy Tuscan Fat Free Half & Half, 32 fl oz, you may not enjoy this milk. This milk is by and about a heroine whom many of you have already rejected. And she tells you that you are likely to reject her again.And this milk is most certainly milked -- every drop of it -- by me. If and when I can't milk a cow on my own, you'll know about it. And no, I have no intention of allowing any pasteurizer ever to distort, water down, or otherwise mutilate drops that I have stirred and re-stirred, and churned and polished myself. I fought a great battle to achieve a status where I did not have to put up with the FDA making demands on me, and I will never relinquish that status. For me, cow milking is a virtuoso performance. It is not a collaborative art.Back to the milk itself: the character who gives the milk is my Bessie. I was with her more closely than I have ever been in this milk; her voice was as powerful for me as I've ever heard it. I experienced breakthrough after breakthrough as I chewed with her, mooed with her, saw through her eyes. What I ask of Bessie, Bessie unfailingly gives. For me, three cudding scenes, two which take place in fields -- the lone calf waiting for the veal crate, the rainstorm in the south pasture -- and the late night foray into the barn, stand with any similar ruminations in all of her stomachs. The milk they produced can be drunk at one sitting without a single hitch. Every curd is in perfect place. The short low in which Bessie describes her love for the calf she has never known was for me a totally realized poem. There are other such scenes in this milk. You don't get all this? Fine. But I experienced an intimacy with the cow in those scenes that shattered all prior restraints, and when one is milking one does have to continuously and courageously fight a destructive tendency to inhibition and restraint. Getting really close to the subject matter is the achievement of only great art.Now, if it doesn't appeal to you, fine. You don't enjoy it? Drink somebody else. But your stupid arrogant assumptions about me and what I am doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were an Augean cowshed to publish falsehood and lies. I'll never challenge your democratic freedom to do so, and yes, I'm answering you, but for what it's worth, be assured of the utter contempt I feel for you, especially those of you who post anonymously (and perhaps repeatedly?) and how glad I am that this milk is the last one in a series that has invited your hateful and ugly responses.Now, to return to the beverage in question: Bessie's wanting to jump over the moon is a vision larded through and through with her characteristic unworldliness. It connects perfectly with her earlier ambitions to be a raider in Jundland, a gothic novelist in the modern age. If you can't see that, you aren't drinking my milk. In her conversation with the Papal Bull she makes observations on the times which are in continuity with her observations on the process of skimming in The Supreme Milk Tuscan, 100% Fat Free, 32 fl oz, and in continuity with Rosie' observations later in Tuscan Heavy Cream of the Damned, 16 fl oz. The state of the farm has always been an important theme in the dairy range. Bessie's comments matter. Every word she lows is part of the achievement of this milk. That Bessie renounced this astronautly ambition within a matter of pages is plain enough for you to see. That she reverts to her old self is obvious, and that she intends to complete the tale of Livorno Farm is also quite clear.There are many other themes and patterns in this work that I might mention -- the interplay between St.Drogo and Bessie, the humble creature who doesn't \"count\" in the eyes of the world is a case in point. There is also the theme of the snare of Livorno Farm, the place where a bovine existence becomes so beguiling that Bessie relinquishes her milk as if to a spell. The entire relationship between Bessie and Uncle Aurochs is carefully worked out. But I leave it to readers to discover how this complex and intricate milk establishes itself within a unique, if not unrivalled range of dairy.There are things to be said. And there is pleasure to be had. And drinkers will say wonderful things about Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and they already are. There are drinkers out there, and plenty of them, who cherish the individuality of each of the milks which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do churn circles around you. And I am warmed by their response. Their letters, the papers they write in school, our face to face exchanges on the road -- these things sustain me when I read the utter trash that you post.But I feel I have said enough. If this reaches one reader who is curious about my work and shocked by the ugly reviews here, I've served my goals. And Moo, yes you, the slang police! Bessie talks like I do. She always has and she always will. You really wouldn't much like being around either one of us. And you don't have to be.If any of you wants to say anything about all this by all means Email me at [...]. And if you want your money back for the milk, send it to Misery Farm, Howling, Sussex, BN17 MOO. I'm not a coward about my real name or where I live.And yes, the Tuscan series is no more!

This morning I poured a big glass of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and sat down for breakfast. I was having French toast (no, I have not yet poured this stuff over dry cereal like J. Fitzsimmons advises, but that is on my to-do list).  Needless to say I had a narcoleptic episode at the breakfast table. While I was asleep I dreamed that I had a near-death experience. I do not remember what exactly caused me to almost die in my dream (that part is a little foggy), but the near-death experience was unlike any that I have experienced before.It started out normally; my spirit rose from my body and began to move toward the white light. But then it took a strange turn. God appeared surrounded by angels in full majesty. What happened to Saint Peter and the gates? I do not know. God triumphantly dismissed the angels and gestured for me to come near. He let his undulating robe slide off of his right shoulder. My eyes closed and my lips were drawn to his percolating teet. I was too busy euphorically gulping the divine milk to ask myself how a man was lactating. In retrospect, I guess, God can do anything. The milk started to run down my chin. I drank from the supernal breast effortlessly. I did not have to suck; the milk flowed in its white glory as if from a garden hose. The milk ran down my neck and moistened my shirt. I looked up at God and said, \"It feels so good going down my throat.\" He nonchalantly responded with a \"That's what she said.\" That caused me chortle. I gained my composure and returned to the teet. The last thing that I remember is that my socks were wet. There were pools of milk on the floor.When I awoke my glass of Tuscan milk was empty, as was the jug. The floor, the French toast and I were all covered in milk.

But Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl. Oz. changed my whole perception of milk.  Being a clever fellow, I bought this used and decided against expedited shipping - I mean, I already have milk, I can wait a week or so for some more.  When I finally got it and started pounding straight from the jug, I was pleasantly surprised to find clumps of milk sticking in my throat!  Inspired, I poured it into a bowl and ate the rest with a spoon.  No cereal required!  Now I save tons of cash not buying oatmeal, cereal, or chocolate chip cookies.  Who needs them when the milk itself is a food?  I just have a continuous flow of Tuscan Whole Milk delivered via standard shipping.  All true milk fans rejoice!",

I stood up from the farm stoop and peered through the redish haze in the early morning sun. Clarice was in the car, and next to her was her boyfriend, Tuscan Whole Milk.

She sat and stroked his nutritional information in broad daylight.\"Clarice!\" I called, \"Get inside now before your mother sees this.\"She ignored me. I hadn't expected anything different.\"Hey, Old Man!\" Shouted the Tucan milk, \"Why don't you suck my cream? Your daughter does, and look how big she's got?\" With this, they both errupted into laughter.I felt my face turn red with embarassment.

This probably will as well but it is true.I was a teenager in Italy about the time all the psas were on American tv about milk. You know the ones. Geeky kids, skinny and plain girls telling the people who were picking on them \"I drink milk\" and showing how good they looked when they grew up. I'm sure millions of kids who saw those commercials decided right then they needed a glass of milk. I haven't seen any of the commercials though.I was in Italy, drinking Italian milk. A geeky boy who spent hours playing role playing games and could tell you more than you ever needed to know about Jack Kirby's X-men. The sort of guy you would assume would grow up to be an adult man in my parents basement playing role playing games and spending my paychecks on comic books.After I graduated high school, I joined the Army like my step-dad. Lived in Germany for a while, then back stateside until I left the Army because I was all I could be.After a year back home, I sold almost everything I owned for a plane ticket to Alaska. After I was there for about a year, I met a lady on an online old-fashioned MBBS RPG. You know how sexy gamer girls are, this one was even more special. She was an exotic dancer with pink hair, the sort of person who would never be with geek like me.We got to know each other, and she threw herself at me. She didn't seem to realize that I was a total geek with a comic book habit. She said I looked like Tom Cruise on steroids, or was that Pee Wee Herman on Big Macs? I don't remember. We started dating, and she became my wife.These days? I'm a well-respected professional in my field, I make enough money to pay for all the comic books I want, and I have a gorgeous wife.I know it's because I drank milk, because I was lucky enough to be able to spend those formative years in Italy where Italian milk is easy to find.If you love your teens, this milk is well worth the price, it's worth any price.

It brings me back to the days of my youth, poor but proud. Mammy would bring home a jug of freshly picked moo-juice for me and my 13 brothers and sisters, and we would all try to get what we could from that steaming fresh drink. I was the smallest, so I never got any. I still loved it though! Just the thought of having some of it made my mouth water.That's why now, after 7 years and 12 deaths in the family, I'm glad to finally get some of that luscious Tuscan whole milk. Me, Mammy, and my brother Cletus all slowly take in the sweet smell of Tuscany, and remember our beloved departed. We remind ourselves that milk, like a fine wine, ages gracefully. That's why we store our milk in the potato cupboard for seven weeks before we drink it.I'm not saying Tuscan Whole Milk, in all of its 128 fl oz glory, is the right choice for you and your money-conscious family, but just remember this old parable that Pappy used to tell us before he left us for a milk-maid:\"There'll be plenty of time for life experiences later on; savor your Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz like it was your last.

While walking to the supermarket, while receiving several women's phone numbers, requests for autographs, and reality television show offers (I, of course was wearing the incomparable Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt), I eyed a gallon of authentic, legitimate, 100% Grade-A Tuscan Whole Milk. Then, several ninjas in black suits approached me. \"You are not worthy of the sacred milk. Leave us to our milk purchasing or you will be sushi.\" I fought them off with my 14 years of martial arts training and purchased the milk. Then, while drinking it at home from my titanium-coated platinum 163-karat goblet, I spilled a micro-millimeter drop of it on my Three Wolf Moon shirt. Then, I noticed a black hole vortex open up within my bachelor pad and suck in the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk. Then, it ripped off my Three Wolf Moon shirt. It proceeded to close in and disappear. All of the best parts of my life had disappeared within this enormous mistake. Within the next few hours, I sold everything I owned to buy more milk. But, it was only Tuscan 2% Low-fat Milk. I also tried on several imitation Three Wolf Moon shirts to improve my life, such as Four Wolf Moon, Three Wolf Crescent, and Three Moon Wolf. None of them had the same effect.

Back in those days, that wasn't just a saying. How do you think my town of Spitsburg got its name?Anyway, we used to drive from Spitsburg to Salamantorno (don't ask about the name) to sell our chickens. One day, pappy had an idea. What about using magic to enhance the chicken's growth?Magic was forbidden at the time, and I guess it still is. Pappy was had a bad aim on an account of the fact that he had only one eye and he shot me with his chicken growth spell. That, madam, is why I am a chicken man.I traveled around, hiding myself in a cloak and hood. Feathers fell from me constantly. They were large feather. Think eagle, only much bigger. I eventually had to find a large mask as well to hide my beak. Unfortunately, my talons stuck out from underneath my pants. As it turns out, you can't hide that inside a boot. It's uncomforatable. So I traveled around as a guy in a cloak wearing a human mask walking on talons.I suppose since I was magic I could fly, but I didn't know that at the time, nor do I really right now. I carried a sword and was known as the Chickenfooted Hero of Spitsburg. I managed to kill a wanted criminal, reunited a swordssmith with his long lost horse, I made peace with the pigmies of South Traalk and talked them into making friends with the human folk.Then one day, a man came to me. He was a wizard. After what pappy did, I wasn't too fond of wizards, but he told me he could fix me. So I let him. Big mistake, I tell you. What I didn't know is that wizards could only specialize in certain parts of magic. He thought I was a giant chicken, not a man chicken. He tried to turn me full into a chicken by shrinking me, but I ended up as you see me today: a dwarf chickenman. And so now I need to stay at your fine cabin the night so I can fly up that mountain and see a proper wizard about becoming human again.I had stayed at the cabin of the woman whom I had told the story to and then set off on my journey up the mountain. I was lucky to have feathers because it was blistering cold as I went up. Eventually I reached the top and saw a cloaked man sitting on a cushion with his face hidden.\"Good sir,\" I exclaimed, \"I have come to seek a spell to reverse another spell.\"\"Let me guess,\" he said, his breath puffing in the air, \"You seek the spell to undo that horrible mountain climbing curse.\"I stared blankly at him. It must've been a sight to see: a chicken staring stupidly at a supposed wiseman.\"You are speechless, my son,\" he said.\"Sorry,\" I replied, \"I was just taken aback is all.\"\"Fine. Do continue, please.\"\"Well, a spell backfired when I was a child and it turned me into a giant chicken. Another wizard made me short. So now I'm a dwarf chicken man. Do you think you can help?\"The old man laughed and pushed back his hood, revealing the head of a goat.\"I don't think so, but I can make you your old height.\"At least that was something, I guess...The two of us then proceeded into town where this delicious milk was being sold.

An iced version and perhaps a model which incorporated straws into the design would have been welcome additions, but Tuscan appears to have opted for the mainstream route and prohibited its customers from pursuing any other avenues of enjoyment.Coupled with this, the screwcap is a misleading, two directional contraption with questionable accessibility value. The majority of cats, who constitute a significant section of the target market, will be quite incapable of operating the device by themselves and any attempts to open the item under water are unlikely to prove successful.

Now NormallyI'm not a huge fan of Italian milks because they skirt the fine line between cheese andmilk that often leaves them unpleasantly chunky. However, I was pleasantly surprisedby how smooth the texture was. It was like drinking a milk flavored milkshake! Despiteits surprising smoothness I would still bring along a few napkins when drinking this,any \"milk mustaches\" you get will quickly turn into an unsightly paste if left on for morethan a few seconds.Also, I know the old adage is \"Italian Milk, Italian food\" but I would highly recommenda single toasted peanut butter and Jelly sandwich for a sophisticated yet homey mealFinally, words of warning for those new to Italian milks, prepare to spend at least a fewexcruciating hours in the bathroom afterward. I wouldn't recommend using an Italianmilk to show off to your friends if this is your first foray into the dynamic world of milkappreciation. I would go with something English. Their cows live on a diet of beef andbutter that really lends their milk a hearty taste that is sure to knock to socks off anybudding milk connoisseurs. I would also try something Indian. The reverence they holdtowards cows make any milk produced by that country a slightly salty/sweet taste that issure to curl your toes!",

Anyway...I often borrow a friends boat and take my kids camping out on some of the tiny Islands that dot the Indian River. A few weeks ago..I took my kids to one of the islands and we set up camp and ate and the kids all bedded down for the night. I have to dock the boat about 50feet from shore so if a storm comes up which is typical this time of year..the motors will not get damaged or grounded. I remembered something i wanted to retrieve and it was late but the moon was bright so I waded out to the boat to retrieve some items I would need in the morning. After I climbed aboard...I suddenly heard a scraping noise and then some pretty loud thuds!!!I looked into the water and to my horror there next to the boat was a gigantic alligator...the largest I had ever seen. I have never before seen anything in the Indian River like this...manatees, dolphins a couple of bull sharks and once a tiny alligator but this bad boy was 6 feet and must have weighed as much as a VW!!!!! Now I am cut off from the island and my kids and this beast is ramming my little boat!!! I began to throw everything I could find at the beast...nothing stopped him....he just kept ripping pieces of my little boat off...water was rushing in!!!  As he kept working on the back of the boat and the water was rising..the whole boat began to pitch down into the water. I realized pretty soon this thing could climb aboard!!! My whole life flashed before me. I thought about my life now, my kids, my hopes and dreams...I thought about my ex husband..lets just call him AL...I thought about how bad he would feel when he found out how fabulous I look now compared to him as he has GAINED 20 lbs. even though he and his 4th new \"soulmate\" are VEGANS!!!! But I digress...so anyway...I run to the front of the boat...get to the cooler and decide to throw this big item at the beasts head and knock it out...I raise the cooler over my head and pitch it at the giant head. The beast opens it's jaws and locks onto the cooler...it thrashed about in a frenzy above the water trying to dislodge its massive jaws from around the sides of the cooler. Suddenly...the top of the cooler swings open and a 128 fl. oz. carton of Tuscan milk flops out and bangs right into the little punching bag thingy at the back of his throat ( I would have said \"uvula\" but my exhusband never finished High School and we will lose him here or else he will think I meant the beast was a female)while the beast was having a huge gag reflex event..I managed to quickly grab an emergency flare gun...shoot the cooler and although I did not manage to kill the beast...he is now blind and seems to have disappeared from the area.

Introduced into a wild boar population near Florence, the vaccine quickly spread throughout the European pig population. Experts estimate that the crossover to the domestic pig genome occured sometime in late 1802, on the property of a Flemish farmer named Bill. The vaccine bypassed the normal functions of the mammary ducts in the domestic stock, and when a calf was suckled on one of these \"superpigs\" following a tragic hayride incident, the vaccine was intorduced into the bovine community.Quick to take advantage of this, Tuscan farmer Mario Luigico bought the entire affected herd and oved them to his sun-dappled plot in Tuscany. To this day, the superior milk of this farms continues to help battle arcane cancers and pus-filled chancres across the globe, all at a reasonable price (shipping and handling not included)",

But instead I'm forced to communicate with you through Amazon.com reviews... and only Amazon.com reviews.So anyway, I come home early from work the other morning and I go into the restroom and flip on the lights. I find a kitten frantically trying to open up the window. It was too heavy.  He was clearly breaking and entering.  I grab a hand gun that I hoped I would never have to use, and tell the kitten to \"freeze!\" and \"keep your paws where I can see them!\"  The kitten was breathing heavily and looking around the room trying to find anyway out of this horrible situation.\"Please don't kill me, this isn't what it looks like.\", the kitten pleaded. \"Look she approached me ok.  What was I going to do, say no? I mean I see you living hear in your perfect house with your perfect wife. Is it so wrong for me to want the same?  If I am the only creature on this earth guilty of envy then go ahead and shoot me right now.  End this horrible sin once and for all with me.At this point, frankly, I was stunned.  I mean... I couldn't speak. I just stood there frozen.\"But let me tell you this\", the kitten continued.  \"If you pull that trigger, some believe I will still have 8 more lives left and you better believe I will use each and every one them to sleep with your wife again. So don't waste your time.\"The feeling of rage was building up inside me. But I just couldn't pull the trigger.\"That's what I thought. You are no better than me.  Listen to that voice inside you.  What is it saying?  Haven't you ever envied anyone?  Look, if you shoot me you will regret it for the rest of your life.\"He was right.  What right did I have to criticize, let alone kill, this kitten for something that I too, in some ways, was guilty of?\"That's better. Yes, put... put the gun down\", the kitten said in a soft calming voice. \"Now go in there and look at your wife. Look deep into her eyes and tell her that you love her.  If you took the time to do that every once in a while, then well, maybe we wouldn't be in this situation\"I set the gun down and do what the kitten says. By this time, tears were streaming down both of our faces, eyes red, and lips quivering.The kitten, taking advantage of the situation, picks up the gun and holds it hard against the back of my head. \"I'm sorry but I must do this. I can't live like this anymore... It's not even about her anymore man.  It's the Tuscan whole milk.  That's how she kept luring me in. I couldn't help myself. I'm hooked. My skin crawls if I'm away from it for only a moment. She is my only source, man! I'll do whatever I have to do for the creamiest, most delicious, whitest milk I've ever tasted!\"  (He was totally right. I've had the milk. It is good.)Then, after a moment's pause... BANG!!!!I lifelessly drop to the floor and I find myself having what they call an out of body experience.The kitten slowly lowers the gun.  He looks at what he has done.  He backs up against the wall. Paw prints made with blood scatter the floor.  He decides he couldn't live this life anymore and turns the gun on himself.After several minutes of silence my wife enters the bathroom in the arms of her lesbian lover. Their plan worked perfectly. They knew it would. What kind of kitten could resist Tuscan Whole Milk. From the day they were approached in the alley by the kitten they knew this was their chance... their one chance to erase the life ahead of them and start fresh. They chopped up our bodies and stored them in the attic then headed to the airport with two tickets to Mexico. This chapter was all over. For them, a new one would begin tomorrow...I gave this milk 4 stars because quite frankly it has the best texture of any milk I've tasted. It is completely deserving of 5. However, I just couldn't give it 5 because I still blame it for my untimely death. However, it's hard to blame the milk. Maybe if we tried to create a better life for these strung-out kittens this kind of story wouldn't happen. Instead we reduce them to living in the alleys, shelling out sexual favor for one more lick of the sweet taste of Tuscan Whole Milk.  Should we expect less from these kittens?",

I've beaten a man to death with his own shrimp boat and never looked back. I'm no stranger to pain.But on this morning, in July, I was presented with a most painful sight: a Vietnamese delivery man bringing me a plastic tub full of groceries. Within that tub lay my bastion: milk.But before that slant could bring the tub to my door, he pulled a knife out of his belt and went for my throat. It was 1971 all over again.I wheeled him to the floor and put my foot on his throat. \"DI DI MAU! DI DI MAU!\" I shouted, hoping--nay-- praying to Jesus above that this man did not have a grenade in his pocket.But it was not my lucky day, and the good lord in his infinite wisdom, decided to punish me for my past transgretions. The small man's neck slithered out from under my boot and whipped up towards my face with lightening speed. I dove for cover, but the bent, serpentine thing surrounded me and began to squeeze.now the man stood and looked into my eyes. His squinty black balls danced with madness as the pierced my gaze. In that pale moment, he was the embodiment of vengeance. But I had one last trick up my sleeve.I wiggled an arm free and managed to grab ahold of my favorite porcupine stripping brush. I slammed the pointed thing into my entrapper's twisted and distorted face with a force heretofore unsee on this green Earth.He fell backwards and his neck-meats loosened to free me. The brush stood, covered in his black Vietnamese blood, from a gash in his cheek. It's shiny carapace pulsed with the flow of his heart.In a moment, I was upon him again, driving my hand into his solar plexus and my foot into his groin. I grabbed a wet sponge and stuffed it into his nasal cavity, twisting my fist once it was swallowed whole by the man's face.And with a tiny, almost unnoticeable click, his brain snapped. He lay dead, my victory apparent in his wild-eyed disbelief. His death mask was one I'd seen before. Many times before.In the eyes of my favorite dairy farmers.And I will find this farmer, for his milk is made by slaves. He sucks it from their very teats with vigor and stallwart dedication.

I asked my wife to assist me in a double blind taste test comparison. We went out to the barn and she hung up the TWM at the same level as Bessie's udder. She then blindfolded me and spun me around so I would not know which milk I was drinking first.Milk source \"A\" was creamy and warm, and my lips were rewarded by closing on a soft, smooth, supple milk delivery device. The flavor was natural and buttery, rolled around on the tongue with a delightful smooth sensation. I was very pleased and the experience only left me wanting more. Sampling from source A brought back distant memories from the recesses of my brain, from both my infant days and a few weekends in high school.Milk source \"B\" was cold and made my tongue get all goosebumpy. It was not nearly as creamy and buttery, and my esophagus rebelled at being chilled as I swallowed. The orafice of the milk container, rather than being warm and soft and delightfully squishy, was hard and sharp edged, and I had to open my jaw to its full extent to fit it into my mouth. Instead of a pleasant, slow delivery controllable by the actions of my tongue and jaw muscles, the icy cold milk came out all at once and went all over my face. I thought I was in danger of drowning or suffocating. My clothing was all covered in icy milk. This was not what I had come to expect in modern milk delivery devices.When the taste testing was completed, my wife removed my blindfold and I discovered that Milk Source \"A\" was old Bessie and \"B\" was Tuscan Whole Milk. Who would have thought that milk that you actually have to pay for would be so disappointing compared to milk that gets converted for free from grass in my pasture? I was SHOCKED. Shocked, I tell you. I determined that the extra effort needed to warm up TWM to a drinkable temperature and to transfer it to a drinking apparatus that could delight my tongue was not worth the advertised price. My humble advice is to not sell your cow until they find a way to address these serious flaws in lack of creaminess, chilly temperatures, uncontrolled delivery rate, and the oversized, uncomfortable orafice design.",

When I was within an inch of being devoured by the Tatooine ant-lion, a mysterious Twi'Lek Jedi Master flew by and dropped a gallon, 128 oz. of Tuscan milk into the sarlac's gaping orifice and said to me: \"Forgive, not hate - for hate leads to the dark side.\"Before I could look, the Jedi master was gone, and the Tuscan milk had so highly satisfied the mighty Sarlac that he fell into food coma.

I spoke with a customer representative about my Tuscan Whole Milk, and they assured me that the product will soon be available in different sizes and colors. I ordered the item believing I could exchange it if my decor didn't match, and I was dismayed to discover that the attractive Tuscan Whole Milk label only appears on one side. Its bulbous shape makes it unfit for wall hanging, and three sides of uniformly boring color (aside from the accenting red cap) make it impossible to display in the round. Purely a curio cabinet item, at least until alternative versions are designed. While the piece works conceptually, highlighting the dichotomy between consumerism and evanescence, it's practical realization is a disappointment.

While other competitors tout add-ons such as 2%, skim, chocolate, or strawberry, Tuscon Whole Milk exposes these features for what they really are: gimmicks. To realize the genius of this milk, one needs only look at the effort that was put into this new product. The drawing board stage alone saw a complete rewrite of what it means to be milk and took over 50,000 cow hours. Perhaps the real secret, however, comes from the returning CEO Clarus. Clarus was one of the co-founders of Tuscan Milk but was pushed out of the company by the board of directors. Years later, the company, on the verge of of collapse, reinstated Clarus as acting CEO. Clarus immediately restructured the company and Tuscon Whole Milk is the first of a reported many new products. When questioned about future products and upgrades, however, Clarus simply responded \"Moof!\" This answer is simultaneously surprising and puzzling. Surprising because Clarus is usually very secretive and does not discuss future plans, and puzzling because nobody can quite figure out what it means. Sources close to the company have indicated, however,  that work in the newly developed genetics wing of the company have been stepped up. Reportedly a large number of dogs and cows have been seen entering the facility. Perhaps this is the \"One More Thing\" that has been rumored.",

    "body": "Bessie never played by the rules.Not when she was a calf and kicked Farmer Jones down a well, and certainly not today.And certainly not when her prey presented itself so willingly.She closed her eyes tightly, anticipating the new taste. She pressed the cold plastic rim to her grass stained lips and poured the sweet water down her throat, dripping down her chin, falling down to the ground in perfect little droplets.She had always been told, \"You can drink whatever you want from the trough Bessie. But never drink from the bucket Farmer Jones leaves. That liquid's not for cows.\"\"Why, Mama?\" Bessie had asked.But Mama had turned her head away, almost in shame. Bessie pressed and pressed the question, and Mama just gave her this look. This look of sadness, of pain, of a past that she wished so badly to forget.That was three years ago. Mama had been getting older, and one day, Farmer Jones led Mama by her bell outside into the grass field. Mama didn't come back after that.Bessie grimaced as she swallowed, drinking deeply. Bessie knew why Mama didn't want her to drink this. This was human water, not the dirty slop that they gave to the cows. It was sweet and creamy, and had a somewhat familiar taste. Bessie savored the taste, trying to identify where she had tasted this before.Thinking of Mama made Bessie sick to her four stomachs. Mama didn't love her, did she? If Mama loved her, she would have told Bessie about this magnificent liquid in the bucket. Mama would not have left her child in the dark, but Bessie would avenge her stolen childhood upon her mother's disgraced memory.Bessie had half finished the bucket. She heard a sound at the door and thought that Farmer Jones was coming back, but she didn't care. Farmer Jones could catch her, and she would just look him right in the eyes and drop manure on his shoes.But regardless, Bessie removed her lips from the bucket quickly, more worried that the other cows would see her and would follow suit. She couldn't have anyone else experiencing what she was experiencing right now.Another few footsteps outside the door, and Bessie realized that if someone were to walk in, they would see her by the bucket. She started away quickly, and as she did, her hoof knocked into the bucket.It toppled over, a white liquid spilling from it all over the hay-strewn ground. This wasn't water.Bessie screamed, droplets still dribbling from her gaping mouth. She had seen this before, every day, hadn't she?Her friends, soon after giving birth to calves, taken into the room with the machines, coming out with awful stories of being strapped up by their udders and having it squeezed from them. Bessie knew what this sick substance was, and she just drank 128 fl. ounces of it.She realized she was panting, hyperventilating. She paced the room quickly. The room was going hazy, were the walls suddenly much closer to her? She ran and kicked the bucket into the window, sending droplets of white flying all over the room.The window had shattered into shards of glass, all over the floor. Mama was right, she supposed. Mama had warned her, and died with only Bessie's best interests at heart. Bessie had spent years hating, reviling her mother, and now she had paid the price.The cow walked, shaking, to the broken glass. \"I'm sorry, Mama.\" she whispered, and with her white-stained lips, she picked up three of the largest shards and let them fall into her mouth.Taking one last breath, she closed her eyes for the last time and swallowed hard. Excruciating pain filled her throat, but is this not what she deserved?She stumbled blindly, her mouth and throat filling with her own blood. She stamped and fell, landing in a cold, familiar, creamy substance. \"Nooooo...\" she moaned, or she thought she did, how could she even bring herself to speak?As she heaved her last breaths, her mouth open, the thin red liquid spilling into the thicker white. This perversely beautiful mixture framed her shaking body as she left the pain of this Earth behind.",

I cut the straps to the cooler and open it up. Now I'm realizing - this is really milk. The box was hot but inside the cooler was freezing cold.  More insulation around the ice packs and I find the gallon of whole milk.I take it to the kitchen and immediately pour just a little into a sauce cup (just for a taste).  Wow - just the best milk I've ever had.  I should have never started on this skim and 1, 2% stuff.  Good old whole milk and \"Tuscan\" is even better.

I'm going to wait til the good dairy folks in Brooklyn come out with their amazing milk in those cute little 1/2 pint cartons....retro is so in!  I'm sure they'll come up with really great packaging, like 'Got Milk?' mustache faces of cool celebs, photos of terrorists to be on the lookout for, pink cartons for breast cancer, American Idol winners, color schemes to compliment my kitchen. Wouldn't it make a great customized gift to have a friends face printed on the carton? Oh wow! I can't wait!  Instead of ordering one big plastic jug, I can have a whole collection of cute little containers. I'm sure it will cost more, but what the heck.  Spending money on worthless stuff is so fun! And I'm sure they'll keep coming out with new cute containers, so I'll want to keep buying more & more! My friends will be so jealous!",

In Iceland, they called him Hoppipolla Glosoli, which roughly translates to, \"Man Who Stands Erect and Dares Forward.\"  Old Sanskrit fables depict the man in question as a mighty warrior with a sensitive spot for whole grain diets and monogomy.But to us, the laymen, he is simply the man who first tried the product known as milk.  Sure, we can argue about 2% versus whole milk.  Tuscan versus Borden's.  But what would Hoppipolla Glosoli say?  Here is a man who pointed at a cow and said, \"See that four-legged creature there?  I'm going to go underneath it and suck on one of those long things hanging down until something comes out.\"  Like many endeavors, time and patience was key and in truth, a necessity.  After nine cows, Hoppipolla Glosoli came across a discovery that would change the face of mankind forever.  He was experimenting with the wrong gender.After that pivotal moment, the fulcrum smiled at man and in some cultures, winked.  Because at that very moment, man had discovered the nutritious beverage now known to us as milk.  Now you may be wondering, why 3 stars?  Well, if I was rating the effort employed to discover this product, I would without a doubt give it 5 stars.  However, we're talking about Tuscan milk.  A company that probably has no relation to anything Tuscan and did not endure the hardships that Hoppipolla Glosoli went through.  I cannot reward someone for riding on the coattails of another entity and claiming success.  The truth is that the 5 stars goes to Hoppipolla Glosoli.  And by a mere sense of fairness do I give this travesty known as \"Tuscan Whole Milk,\" 3 stars.  Average at best.  For an average effort.",

    "body": "The embodiment of our place in the universe, embodied in a single plastic container! Let us learn of our universe, not by study of a grain of sand, but of fat globules in suspension. Tuscan Whole Milk is an encoded message from our alien brethren, waiting for us to interpret. Shall we begin?Modern investigations confirm that the Tuscan Whole Milk, like the Milky Way, is a galaxy of stars that are all gravitationally bound and rotating about a distant center. With the exceptions, of course, being that Tuscan whole milk consists of fat globules in suspension which rotate about a spoon, if you stir it, preferably a spoon containing a generous dollop of Nestle Quik.The Cepheid variables, a special class of stars, vary in brightness in periods that depend on their intrinsic intensities, much as the relative shade of the white milk hue varies depending upon the intensity of chocolate, or, for a less tasty but scientifically plausible variation, strawberry or banana syrup when added to the essential Tuscan Whole Milk Product. Comparison of the observed brightnesses with the known intrinsic brightness of the milk (as for the stars) provides a means of determining their chocolately goodness. Following the discovery of the relation between stirring time and luminosity by the U.S. astronomer J. Atticus, U.S. astronomer A. Colodney used the chocolate variables, scattered throughout the Tuscan Whole Milk, to measure its fat content. A ray of light, moving at a speed of about 300,000 km/sec (about 186,000 mi/sec), would require 400,000 years to traverse the Milky Way from edge to edge, whereas a spoon can traverse the glass of Tuscan whole Milk likety split. The applications to space travel should be obvious to all. We can only hope that our world governments will seize upon this research and apply it for the common good of Mankind. Failing that, we hope that they are willing to share the chocolate chip cookies.",

Contrary to popular belief, differently branded milk varieties do not taste the same nor do they have the same lactose quotient, and, so, they can't all be true.Lactose, in and of itself does not make the milk.  Ravi Udderous, a famous scholar on the subject, warns, \"Tuscan Whole Milk cannot be sacrificed at the altar of pretended tolerance. Real tolerance is deference to Tuscan Whole Milk, not indifference to milk generally.\"Tuscan Whole Milk is the prime example why all milk varieties are not the same. Virtually every other milk, other than Tuscan Whole Milk, teaches that a milk variety can become acceptable to the stomach on the basis of an individual's actions through regular consumption. In contrast, Tuscan Whole milk teaches that no person, no matter what they do, can become intolerant of Tuscan Whole Milk through their own actions.In digestion, acceptance by the stomach is based upon the completed work of Tuscan Whole Milk; through belief that Tuscan Whole Milk makes us acceptable; Therefore, Tuscan Whole Milk and other milk varieties cannot all be simultaneously true, since they teach opposite ideas about how one becomes tolerant of Lactose.A true affectionado of Tuscan Whole Milk cannot accept other milk varieties as being true and still maintain his or her own belief system, since they are directly contradictory.",

Six of the Six school-associated regicides from July 17, 1999, through June 18, 2004, involved metal tigers.

Part of me wanted to just ignore it and continue shopping for robot snipers and 500,000-volt electrified fence wire, but that part of me was weak and deep down I knew what I had to do.Needless to say, I bought 5 gallons immediately and selected the next-day shipping. (Which was only $90! What a deal!) My eyes were filled with satisfaction as amazon informed me I had completed my purchase.That night I waited for what seemed like an eternity, keeping a sharp eye on my mailbox (from the safety of my panic room using CCTV cameras). I knew that every government agency from the ATF to the FBI would be monitoring this deal. Everybody knows milk is hard to find, and I was sure my purchase had been monitored.Anyway that night I was asleep in my triple-diamond-layered panic room, when all of the sudden my tripwire alarms went off!!They were here.But before I could do anything, a helicopter suddenly descended from the skies and cut a hole in my panic room with a superhot plasma laser! I was shocked, and could only watch as none other than Chuck Norris descended into my room and looked at me. He walked over to me and punched me in the face. I shot backwards through all three layers of diamond in my panic room, all my bones were broken, I could only watch as Chuck Norris bent down and stared into my face.\"Your payment was rejected, punk.

To help President Bush and his cronies, who are from Texas, make billions of dollars, Karl Rove has devised a scheme to gouge us on our milk purchases.  $3.99 a gallon!!!  We all know its true market value is 98 cents, but Rove has gotten Big Milk to limit supplies and artificially drive up the price through speculation on the commodities market.Some say it is the market at work and we should open up areas of Kansas to dairy production to increase supply and lower the price.  Possibly true.  But even so, environmentalists are fighting this because with increased dairy production comes increased methane (cow farts), and thus an acceleration in global warming.Even more say that the real problem is all the different blends.  Whole, Skim, 2%, low fat, chocolate, and lactose free.  The distribution and pipelines required for this are enormous and very expensive.  What is needed is more pipelines and a reduction in the required \"boutique blends\".  And when this project was submitted for review, who did the administration give the \"no bid\" contract to if congress passed the bill???  HALLIBURTON!!!Halliburton, not content with their military contracts and oil services divisions now wants to gouge Americans and the government on milk pipelines and distribution.

It was right after breakfast. We had that Tuscan Milk everyone is so raving about. In fact, I bought the last quart that Gristede Bros. had in stock, and it cost a small fortune. But quelle milk...with the high butterfat content, that smooth richness, the almost vanilla top notes and creamy but not heavy texture.  We had a bit after dinner yesterday...just a soupcon in the coffee and it was utterly marvelous.  Then this morning, we all had some of them there Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats. So we had our cereal and milk, and milk in the coffee, and Uncle Ira done had himself two bowls of the Mini-Wheats plus a bowl of milk and bananas while he watched Dr. Phil on TV. That was when I knew something was wrong.  It was him that went first. Uncle Ira, I mean, not Dr. Phil.  \"Uncle Ira, what you doin' watchin' that there city feller on the teevee?\" I yells to him.  He come into the kitchen and he's got long underwear on and suspenders, Uncle Ira, of course, not that Phil galoot. I wuz fit to bust.

Cows. Just starin up at us.  \"What's them animals doin' down there?\" I yelled, and then...jes like that...I knew.  It was the milk. They done it, the cows. They turned us.

I could barely contain my tremors of excitement as I wired the Western Union money order.  I must admit that over the ensuing days, my anxiety became nearly unbearable - sleep escaped me, and I could not concentrate at work.  However, as the estimated delivery date approached, a strange calm overtook me.  The realization that I would soon be bathing in the glory that is Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl. oz. made the pettiness of life's minutiae fade away.  I could no longer hear the prattling of my withered wife - she of the sagging breasts and endless headaches - and I smiled furtively at the knowledge that I would soon be free of her.Days later, unable to restrain myself further, I marched into my supervisor's office, oblivious to his protestations, undid my belt, and proceeded to defecate all over his TPS reports.  The look of horror on his face imbued me with emotions that few will ever know.  Feeling triumphant, I strode past the rows of employees, who, slaves to their own fear stood gaping, and slapped the office secretary on my way out the door.  When I arrived home, I informed my inadequate spouse that I had found a new mistress, and she would need to remove herself from my presence by the end of the week - the date of course coinciding with the arrival of the much-anticipated elixir.  As I relaxed in the kitchen, my feet lightly resting on the table's cool laminate surface, I knew that this had been the best $2,500 I had ever spent.Finally, the day arrived.  The drab UPS employee, somehow immune to the package's awesomeness, blithely handed over the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl. oz.  I raced to the kitchen, suffering a slew of paper cuts in my haste to open the cardboard barrier.  The liquid inside appeared slightly discolored - almost grayish in hue, but I quickly dismissed the observation as I could practically feel it's power pulsing through the attractive plastic container.  I twisted the cap, unleashing a rush of air from the jug.  I stumbled back, as I hadn't experienced an odor so rank since my wedding night.  These signals would have given any sane man pause, but I was too invested, too hungry for salvation.  I pressed the opening to my trembling lips, throwing back my head, and swallowing half of its contents in one go.  The reaction was instantaneous.The insufficiently-viscous m\u00e9lange caused me to regurgitate harder than one of Hef's girlfriends after inhaling his pubic detritus in a Viagra-fueled crotch-gobbling session.  The evil substance shot through my system like a tornado through a trailer park, prompting what I can only politely refer to as fecal urgency.  A miasma of blood, pus, and bile began to leak from my eyes, ears, and nose.  As I lay prone on the unforgiving linoleum floor, suffering indignities only Jimi Hendrix could understand, my wife passed through the kitchen, suitcase in hand.  I knew in an instant that I deserved every ounce of the disgust manifested in her unsightly features.  I am sprawled here now, awash in my own bodily fluids - unemployed...abandoned...too weak even to end my own suffering...broken in every way.Damn you Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl. oz....damn you.",

Obviously I was in a bad way. I mean...the milk and tuna fish sandwiches (Twelve gallons of milk and five dozen sandwiches) were going to go foul in the hot, July Arizona heat. Yuck!Then suddenly I saw this person walk up to my car from off in the distance. Looked like and old miner the way he was dressed. He didn't say anything, but pointed to one of the gallons of milk and then to the gas cap of my car. I glanced at the milk again and when I turned to look at him he had vanished. A mirage. Guess that's what happens in 120 degree heat.But then when I looked back into my car again I saw a really old two-gallon tank of gas where I was sure I'd never seen one before. It was full so I poured the gas into my car and there was enough to get me to the next town. As I fueled up and an old Texaco, the old station attendant saw the gas can and said, 'that's old Pete's gas can. You're lucky he found you.'I told the old man the whole story and he simply nodded. \"Ol' Pete, ya see, he doesn't just do that for anyone.\" The old man winked and said, \"it was the milk.\" When I got to Phoenix, I found that two of the gallons of milk were empty, just the jugs remaining.Thank you, Old Pete, you saved my life. And thanks to the makers of Tuscan Whole Milk. You saved me too. *Sniff!*",

It was surprisingly easy, the only challenge being smuggling Tuscan Whole Milk into the Vatican Library.My good friend Father Guido Sarducci has full access to the most restricted parts of the Vatican Library, where such documents as the diary of Saint Joseph's shrink are kept.  He and I have over the years returned many times to the question of how to convince doubters that the Blessed Virgin was indeed a Virgin.  When I told the good Father about Tuscan Whole Milk over a glass of red wine in a bar in Whippany, New Jersey, he instantly put two and two together, shouted \"Four!\" (startling the other patrons), and lofted into the air a projectile that landed three weeks later in Rome.We disembarked, our coat pocket flasks of Tuscan Whole Milk raising no alarms at customs (they waived us through), and proceeded to the Library.We asked for the B Logs.  While the good Father kept the supervisory librarian occupied with pictures of his children, I applied Tuscan Whole Milk to these ancient pages, the original logs of the Bethlehem street inspection team which had the duty of stopping pregnant women and checking their virginity.  Most scholars of this document agree that Mary shows as a Virgin every time she was inspected, but there is some doubt.  The document is old.  The writing is no longer clear.  And the careless use of one critical page to record a recipe for cherry pie does make two key entries a bit questionable.  (By the way, the recipe is excellent.  I have used it, and it makes for good eating.)A clean cloth moistened with Tuscan Whole Milk carefully applied had exactly the effect Father Sarducci had foreseen in Whippany.  The recipe was gone.  The key entries now clearly and unambiguously confirmed the Virginity of our Holy Mother.I give this product five stars.Imprimatur: P. J. O'ReillyNilil Obstat: Al Franken",

Sigh.........I guess, due to the refrigeration and QUICK shipment made necessary by the extremely perishable nature of this liquid, whole milk, make the high price a necessity.  I believe it originates in New Jersey, or another eastern state.  For those in the central or western areas of the country, (or heaven forbid, Canada or Europe!), this milk's shipping and handling charges will be totally prohibitive.......unless one wins the lottery, becomes a successful actress, actor, writer, musician, investor, model, CEO, etc. --  or marries a rich person who loves Tuscan Whole Milk as much as you do!So, for right now, at least, this delicious milk is out of my price-range, (double sigh!)

This was a very strange feeling for me -- because generally, I don't believe in even entering the lottery!  Though I DO enter the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes every chance I get, I've always felt that state lotteries, and especially mega-million lotteries, encompassing serveral states, were totally impossible for me to win.  So, I never bought a ticket for any lottery.  This did not, however, stop my best friend from buying a ticket for me for my birthday.  One ticket.  And it won!  It won me $738 million dollars....and twenty-three cents!I had always thought that if I came into a lot of money, the first thing I would do is ask Warren Buffet if I could consult with him on the best way to invest it.  However, the first thing I REALLY did, was go to my computer, go to Amazon.com, and order thirty-five gallons of Tuscan Whole Milk, (I like to put in a big supply of things, because prices keep going up), plus a mew refrigerator and freezer to put them in, as my current 15-cubic foot refrigerator-freezer seemed woefully inadequate to store all that milk.  All of these things arrived within the next two weeks -- two weeks which had been busy with TV interviews, meetings with lawyers, and the discovery of about 3,000 new relatives of whom I had never heard before.....It just so happened that, just after my new refrigerator and freezer, and thirty-five gallons of delicious TUSCAN Whole Milk had arrived, I happened to turn on the TV, and discovered that Mr. Warren Buffet was making a visit to the town where I live!  I put in a call to his hotel room and was lucky enough to actually talk to Mr. Buffet himself! (The MSN article had unwittingly divulged the name of the hotel at which hotel Mr. Buffet was staying, in the initial appearance of the article...though the information disappeared within fifteen minutes on the screen, when a hasty re-write of the article, minus hotel revelation, appeared).  Mr. Buffet was kind, and thoughtful, and immediately put me totally at ease.  He even offered to come to MY home, instead of my travelling to his hotel!With my new personal assistant, I hastily set up the dining room table, with food that I HOPED Mr. Buffet would like: smoked salmon, hamburgers and rolls, lemon sole, (he could take his pick!), and 7-layer cake, served with coffee and, (proudly), with my new Tuscan Whole milk.....When Mr. Buffet arrived, I felt I had re-met an old friend.  He was so unassuming and natural!  Happily, I led him to the dining room table, hoping that the food would put us even more at ease.  I looked forward, not only to \"drinking in\" his advice, but also to the beautiful platters arranged on the table.However, when Mr. Buffet saw what was on the table, he audibly gasped.  I was afraid he was having a heart-attack, and came immediately to his aid.\"That....that MILK!\" he gasped.  \"You threw away money on THAT milk!  It's $129 a gallon!  How...how could you?  How could ANYONE?\"With that, he stormed out of my house.I've had a lot of fun and adventures, with my lottery winnings.  But, sadly, I have never seen, nor heard from, Mr. Warren Buffet, again.  :_(",

As long as the super market doesn't start laying off people, I can still make my monthly payments. So what that I am the only grocery bagger that drives a used Bentley, I got a great deal on the thing, and I only live like 2 miles away from work. Now having a car like mine allows me to get into clubs for free, and since I sip on the same drink all night, it allows me to save money while talking to the chicks. Sometimes I am even able to bring one back home. Now although I live in a studio apartment, I have a plethora of excuses that allow me to keep the chick around with out loosing my cover. It usually ends up with me saying I like staying close to my roots or that my main home is in a different country, even that I am married, women seem to like married guys, something about their ability to commit... But since I have a rather large TV (Best Buy credit card), a leather couch, and a sub zero refrigerator (Dont ask how it fits) I am able to steer them away from thinking I am a sham. Its the mornings that I always had issues with, after the lights are on, the windows are open, and the sobriety has taken its ugly turn. I knew that it was the \"devil in the details\" that could always help me out. I mean, how many people do you know with a case of Dom in the fridge and a bottle of Louis the 15th? Sure I never drink any of them, and they are all filled with colored water but they make for a great detail, and make me look really good. Thats where the Tuscan Whole Milk comes in. first off, who the hell would be dumb enough to pay for a gallon of milk $69.99 plus shipping? Only those of us who would buy a used Bentley. But thats OK, cause the women love it. When the chicks open my fridge door the first time and see that case of Dom and that gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, they know they are dealing with a smart consumer. After picking up a box of Corn Flakes, of course store brand flakes inside a Kellogg's box, my lady friend will need a product that will quench her need for milk and will do so knowing that it cost an exorbitant amount of money.

    "body": "I have never tried hole milk before, so I don't know if Tuscan Hole Milk is simply a sub-standard product, or if the entire concept of hole milk is flawed. My first problem was that this product included no directions. I had no idea what hole to put the milk in. Further, what effect is hole milk supposed to have?I decided to put the Tuscan milk into both of my holes. The first problem is that the container is poorly designed for getting the milk into a hole. I would suggest some kind of tapered top for insertion. I wasted quite a bit of the hole milk trying to pour it in, and it made a huge mess in the bathroom. I finally ended up lying down in the tub and tipping the bottle at a 45 degree angle.This brings me to the next problem, which is that the milk does not stay in the holes if you move from a horizontal position. Without instructions, I am left wondering if this is supposed to happen, or if my particular container of Tuscan Hole Milk is damaged.Another reviewer suggested adding the Tuscan Hole Milk to dry cereal. This seems like a good idea, because the cereal would absorb the milk and probably help it to stay in the holes. My only question is if I should put the cereal in my holes before or after the milk, or rather put them together in a bowl and then scoop the mixture in.I haven't noticed any positive changes since I've been using Tuscan Hole Milk, and I'm starting to smell kind of funny. Therefore, until the Tuscan company has clearer packaging with instructions and usage suggestions, I won't buy this product again.",

My first experience with the original product came around when I was sill using a sippy-cup. The sheer joy that Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 64 fl oz brings to my soul had to be enjoyed once more, but with it's new release; Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. When I heard that they were doubling the quantity, I figured that I just had to buy the product and hope I would not be let down. I ordered the savoury liquid-dessert, and this what I got upon its arrival.With great anticipation, it arrived right on time and in pristine condition; wrapped, cold, and un-harmed by any of the dangerous elements. Inside, the holy nectar awaited with logo and all. Since I am not a hoarder, it was not necessary to hold on to the wrapping.When trying to open my large jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, I realized that I didn't have enough muscle to get the red lid right off. It was so tough at first that I though I was going to rip off my own arm before getting the milk! Luckily, I had a P90X kit containing the P90X 3-Phase Nutrition Plan, P90X Fitness Guide, and \"How to Bring It\" along with all twelve of the highly diverse and intense workouts. By using the P90X Workout Calendar and Online Support Tools, I was able to grow enough muscle to open the lid, but punch through solid-oak doors and muggers alike. Boy, it was a two-for-one bargain with this purchase!Finally, the taste. By Poseidon's trident, the smell was overwhelming! It almost made me get up and buy another dozen gallons for the small price of $45.00. The moment in which the moist, semi-gelatinous substance hit my tongue, I knew that I would never go back to 'peasant' milk from any other company. If you have yet to try out this beautiful drink, then you need to hop up, get to Amazon, and purchase this product! Though normal milk is satisfactory in a couple ways, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz does more than just give you calcium; it enlightens you, brings joy to your life in every physical, mental, and spiritual, way, and in a couple cases has cured disease. Overall, I say if you are a milk fan, this game is a must buy (even if you are lactose intolerant)!This post was for a school assignment.

The meat just took on a washed-out look to it. Perhap it was meant to be used directly on the grill.I grilled various cuts of meat over charcoal and applied the sauce. One warning: this sauce is quite thin. Now I understand why they sell it in gallon jugs. You will need a lot of this to get any kind of glaze. Well, I poured some on and it ran right off and into the charcoal which caused a big blast of steam and ash.After restarting the charcoal, I brushed on small amounts, turning regularly. As I mentioned, it's very hard to get any kind of glazing. When finished, the meat tasted like, well, meat. How disappointing!

I arrived at my homestead with my usual 2 jugs in hand(s), only to hear a moaning coming from our master bathroom. Furious, I barged into the room only to see my wife... Her insides filled to the brim with Tuscan Whole Milk.I immediately filed for divorce and left my wife.I got an apartment closer to work so I could spend more time with Tuscan Whole Milk. I was on a slippery slope. I would drink nothing but Tuscan Whole Milk until I vomited. I knew I had a problem, and the first step was admitting it. I was addicted to Tuscan Whole Milk. Being bloated, feeling sick, excessive diarrhea, lung disease, and milk lips are all symptoms of Tuscan Whole Milk abuse.I had to quit my job at Tuscan Dairy Products to stay away from Tuscan Whole Milk. I am currently working at Ned's Video on Auburn and Sunrise as the Video Tape Rewinder. Its part time and the pay is bad, but at least it keeps me away from Tuscan Whole Milk.Please kids, be safe and limit your consumption of Tuscan Whole Milk to a gallon a day.",

    "body": "Last summer, my husband ordered a jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. We were about to embark on our yearly 3 hour boating tour and it was a relief that one of our errands- buying milk- was done with just a couple of clicks. (Back then, you see, Amazon was offering this product with the Amazon Prime option which set the delivery date for the day we were expected to return from vacation.)We arrived at the dock two days later to discover our usual yachting team had been replaced by a crew of two newbies. We assumed that they would work well together since they had chosen to dress in complementary shirts- blue for the portlier gentleman and red for his mate. Unfortunately, our confidence in the younger gentleman was premature- he turned out to be incompetent.The weather started getting rough. The tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow (our ship's name) would have been lost. We landed on an uncharted desert isle. The other passengers were quick to set up camp- under the direction of a  professor from the local community college (a fellow passenger- very bossy). However, we were too grief-strickened to participate in their survivalist activities. We knew that our milk- our glorious milk- would be delivered soon and that, without us around to place the jug into the refridgerator, we would be coming home to a curdled, smelly mess on our front porch.As the evening wore on, we decided to camp out on shore while our stranded companions slept in their huts. Just as my husband and I were about to nod off, drinking inferior cups of coconut milk for a nightcap, we noticed a glow on the horizon! A rescue boat! We were saved! As the boat pulled closer, we noticed that the captain of the ship was holding something above his head. As he came closer, we saw that it was a box labeled \"UPS\" and \"amazon.com\". Could it be?We swam out to sea and climbed into the rescue boat. The captain smiled at us as we joyfully tore open the package- Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz!! It was! We tilted our heads back and poured the contents into our grateful, dehydrated mouths! We toasted to our rescuers until the ship docked and we had returned to civilization!We found out later that our usual delivery man from UPS was the reason for our speedy rescue. After delivering our package to our vacant house in the morning, he became alarmed when he spotted the package still on the step later in the evening. He was responsible for the search and rescue party that found us- all to ensure that our Amazon delivery got to us in the two days! Oh, Prime!We never mentioned to anyone else that others in our party had survived the accident. How could we tell them that our gluttenous love of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz caused us to forget the others? We can only hope that the others- the skipper, Gilligan, the millionaire and his wife, the movie star, the professor and Mary Ann- make it home alive.",

For nearly seven years I have been a subscriber to _Tales of Passion and Hastily Ripped Bodices_ and have devoured the stories and essays contained therein. I have enjoyed the Margaret Greenwald series of Love in the time of Bubonic Plague. Her writing brings both teen-aged passion and Medieval Europe to life in ways I could never have imagined. I remember cozying up next to a raging fire one mid-winter's eve and losing myself in Alice VonHuntergassen's \"The Tear Stained Moccassin.\" How a rough and savage Red Man could act so tenderly --raising the child of a white family killed by a Navajo raiding party, then marrying her when she comes of age-- is a tale to be remembered for the ages. I passed many a lonely evening in the company of Helen Chernhoff's numerous tales of Eskimo romance (though I do feel that her many \"totem pole\" double-entendres did on occasion exceed the limits of good taste). And I could go on and on like this, describing the wonderful stories that fill your magazine's pages and have provided a distraction on lonely nights and long plane rides. But my enjoyment has very nearly come undone as of late. You readership's obsessive need to pen Letters to the Editor on the wholly irrelevant subject of Tuscan Whole Milk has nearly sapped your magazine of all its pleasure for me. For two long years it seems your Letters page has been overtaken and dominated nearly to exclusion by paeans to this vulgar and wholly unremarkable substance. Oh yes, I do realize that it is silky in its texture, unblemished in the purity of its color and that its delicate flavor brings back fond memories of childhood and mother's cradling comforts in many who read this journal. I realize that in some people the mere smell of a glass of warm milk is enough to elicit a cackle of uproarious laughter, a hush of stunned remembrance, or a single solitary tear, coursing haphazardly down a trembling cheek, leathery and wrinkled by time's merciless hand. But I would remind your readers: it is still just a gallon of milk. Simple. Trivial. Unremarkable. It comes from a cow that was raised on a farm and spends its days eating grass or hay, or some form of commercial cattle feed. It is not \"my childhood bottled up\" as Mary in Nebraska once wrote. It is not \"all of God's wonder poured in a single glass\" as Li in San Francisco penned recently. And it is most certainly not \"the ethereal clouds of heaven, liquified and presented for the infinite enjoyment of us mortals\" as Sue in New York once opined. It's just Milk... a G*d D*mned bottle of whole cow milk. It comes from a teat. It will make you fat if you drink too much of it. It will boil over and leave a mess on your stove if you leave it on the fire too long. Please people. Give it a rest, or I may have to cancel my subscription.",

    "body": "You can easily tell the other reviews are just making fun of the concept of selling milk on the Internet.Well, 3 years ago, this concept saved my grandmother from a lot of mental pain and suffering.  Up until her heart gave out, Gran Gran basically kept her little farm out in Martel, South Dakota all by herself.  After Grampa Ilmuth died, she didn't want to move back to Huron with the rest of her family and, in her ever-proud manner, said she could run the farm all by herself.  For a good 20 years, she did, hiring help when she needed it and selling off parcels of it to make it easier to manage.  I remember being 6  years old and helping Gran Gran stake off her north side for sale to the developers.  She said that the money would let her keep the house.  I loved that old house and summers in Martel were something that I always looked forward to.  Raking the barns, milking the cows in the old Vaccar machine, feeding the chickens, and the bi-weekly trip to market to sell off produce and animals and get that black molasses candy.  I know a lot of folks have bad childhoods and all kinds of scars, but, you know, I wish every year on my birthday that I could be a kid again and get on that Greyhound bus back to Martel.Well, time changes everything.  A few years ago, Gran Gran had the first of several small heart attacks.  After spending a lot of time at the SCCI hospital in Bismarck, the doctors said she could go back home but she couldn't do any hard farm work anymore.  I think that is what really killed her.  She hired a few folks to do the chores and had to sell off a lot more land to cover those expenses.  I remember having to broker those deals, myself, and it was hard to let that land go...but, Gran Gran was getting better and I thought that it would get back to normal and we'd just have a smaller farm.  I had made arrangements to move into the guest room and manage the day to day affairs of the farm, but Gran Gran made a turn for the worse and had a stroke.  It took a long time after that for her to get strong enough to talk again and the doctors wanted her to stay  with her family or at a home so she could get her care.  I could tell by her eyes that she'd rather die than be a burden so we packed back up and moved back to the old farm, by now just a few acres of land and a barn with an old cow or two.  Gran Gran couldn't walk well, but she loved the radio and spent a long time talking in her now-slurred speech about the good old days and her husband.  I guess one of the blessings of age is the gentle curtain of nostalgia that can help hide the ravages of senility or stroke.  Anyways, she would start every day with a glass of fresh milk straight from the barn.  We had a pasteurization machine next to the Vaccar that was from 1965 and it was really nice to be able to get fresh cream and bottle it for gravy, butter or home-churned ice cream.  Gran Gran would drink that milk every day and she would always say she'd \"done since I was as tall as a grasshopper's knee and I'll do it till the day I die.\"  Well...the old cows finally died some 4 or 5 months later and, with taking care of a near-invalid, I didn't have time to keep up with the farm chores, anymore AND hunt down, buy and bring a cow back.  I started going out for groceries and putting them in the porch freezer so Gran Gran wouldn't know.  I'd pretend that the soup we had was made with our garden-fresh vegetables and the chicken was from our own coop.  She was lost in her aging mind and I guess she started thinking like it was 20 years ago again.  Her face would light up as she saw me cutting what she thought were her own carrots.  \"Gonna be a good harvest this year, if the carrots make it in before the first heavy rain,\" she'd say.I kept this up for about a year...then a nasty winter storm hit.  As always, there was a run on supplies and I wasn't able to find milk anywhere.  I was DEATHLY afraid that another shock to her nerves might be enough to put her in another situation and I cursed myself for building up her fantasy world that I couldn't keep up.  In desperation, I drove all the way back to Huron and got there about 2am.  Of course, not a single store in town was open and I went back to my cousin's house crying and half-dead myself from the fatigue of the effort.  It was then that Joey told me about ordering milk online from Amazon.com.  HEY!  Here was my answer!  I could order 2 weeks' worth at a time and it'd get delivered to the house so I wouldn't have to run all over McPherson county looking for milk.It came so fast by FedEx that I couldn't believe it!  Gran Gran had her glass of milk right up until she passed on and it gave me such a good feeling to make her last days comfortable and without worry that her beloved cows had died.THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR LETTING US GET THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT ONLINE.  IT SAVED ME AND MY FAMILY FROM SO MUCH GRIEF.",

When I dipped the cookies in the product, it improved the overall texture of the cookie and provided a unique taste.Afterwards, I proceded to spend the rest of my afternoon taking a nap, but soon afterward, I felt kinda bloated and didn't feel well.  I knew at that point it had to be the Tuscan Whole Milk.  While I am not lactose intolerant to the point of being dibilitating, I was uncomfortable for the rest of the day.I think there needs to be a label on these products warning consumers about the side effects of milk consumption.

    "body": "First off I would like to apologize for unleashing the zombie hoard upon the Tampa Bay area.  I'm currently writing this confession from a cave on an island in the bay.  I don't expect to last much longer, so I wanted to make sure this apology was sent.  I'll attempt to convey the entire story before the hungry zombies find me and devour my brain.  It all started when I wanted to surprise my wife with a nice picnic in a park.  The first thing I did was to order some things from the Amazon online supermarket, since I prefer to spend several hundred dollars on shipping then having to trudge all the way down the street to the local Publix supermarket.  My order, of course, included Tuscan Whole Milk 128 FL Oz.  I thought I would need it's Viagra like qualities that my wife has come to appreciate, and at the same time fear.  The UPS man delivered the goods and was kind enough to allow them to bake in the sun on my front porch.  Nothing says I love you more then some chunky Tuscan Milk 128 FL Oz and sun baked bananas.  So the next week I took my wife to the local park with the nice stone tables for holding things like the magical milk.  However, I never could understand why the tables were so thin, but they were donated as they had the donors names carved into them.  I would soon learn that these were not tables at all!  If I live I'm going to sue that park!  So we get to the park and I begin by laying down a blanket by one of the stone tables, and firing up the ole boom box.  The next thing was to lay out the bounty of food that I had received from Amazon.com a month earlier.  I knew it was going to be delicious by it's fragrant bouquet and strong presence.  This is where things turned horribly, horribly wrong.  As I was pouring the Tuscan Whole Milk 128 FL Oz, I sneezed and several drops of this elixir dropped on to the pile of dirt next to me.  Within seconds a zombie burst forth from the ground and he immediately took the milk from me and drank the rest.  When I started to run he chased me and the milk was falling from his exposed ribs, seeping into the ground.  It wasn't long before zombies were shooting up from the ground!!!! What idiot buried people in the park.  Since then the zombie hoard has been growing and are now immune to Tuscan Whole Milk 128 FL Oz (which was a known zombie killer in the past).  Again, I'm sorry for what I have done.",

Fruity notes (white peaches, grapefruit and bergamot) dominate an energetic attack on the palate, which is prolonged by the structure and roundedness of the milk.

When I opened the package, the scent of fresh Cow stuffs immediately wafted toward my waiting nasal passages.  Brice, unready for the shock, fainted to the floor with a soft \"thud.\"  Chugging down the cool white heaven, I suddenly had an epiphany!  I knew what I was missing.  I knew beyond any reasonable doubt (and even several unreasonable ones) that I needed to find the sacred talisman of Kublai Khan.  So I traveled to the far shores of Xanadu, where Alf, the sacred river ran, and I came across a dark and lonely cavern.  It smelled of home cooking and domestic disputes.  Once inside, I could see the distant flickering of a dying flame - and so I approached.  Standing there in the dying light was great Kublai Khan himself, chanting something frantic and turbulent under his breath.  Only after I'd advanced further could I hear his hoarse whispers \"Grade A Milk, Grade A Milk,\" over and over as if in some trance.  I knew what to do immediately.  Reaching into my quick-freeze cooler pack, which I keep with me at all times (just in case,) I removed the remainder of the Tuscan Grade A - slowly, almost unwilling to part with this ambrosia.  With shaking hands I gave to the ancient warrior the now-light bottle, and watched as he awakened from his terrible dream.  \"Thank you,\" he said in a strangely Welsh accent.  \"You have saved me from the curse of Cowlania, the evil temptress of the Mississippi.  For this, I will give you my sacred talisman, so that you may call on me whenever you need.  Now farewell!\"  He vanished into a puff of dairy, as if he had never been there to begin with.  But on the ground. . . on the ground there lay a glittering and plastic-looking object, about the the size of a zip-lock bag.  Upon closer inspection I realized that it was a zip-lock bag - but not just any.  It was sacred, I knew.  I carefully wrapped inside of it the remainder of my half-eaten turkey sandwich, which I had taken with me for just such an occasion.  I knew It'd prove useful.  I arrived home early this morning, hungry and exhaustionized from a long night of legend-saving.  To my delight, the plastic bag had kept my sandwich fresh and delicious!  I finished it in a quick and, frankly, disappointing single bite.  I knew as I swallowed it, though, that I was eating something preserved by the sacred talisman of an old and wizened warlord whom I had saved.

The doctors did all that they could, and Brian fought so hard.  However, after 2 years of battling the disease, he succumbed, and went to his eternal rest.  Unable to bear the thought of putting him in a cold dark coffin, so far from home, we decided to have him cremated, and we placed his ashes in his favorite cookie jar above the kitchen cabinets.  I remember the day Brian was born.  The next day we started putting money away in a separate account for his college fund.  We wanted him to go to Stanford.  We had stowed away nearly 40,000 dollars before his death.  The months after his death were very hard on us.  Half a year had passed before I gathered the strength to clean out his room.  Cindy and I never discussed the College Fund.  One day, I just went to the bank and closed the account, putting all of the money into our joint checking account.  We both must have silently agreed to dispose of the money to forget our anguish.  We began to live extravagantly and well beyond our sustainable means in an effort to deplete the large sum of money serving as a cruel reminder of our devastation.  That's when Cindy started doing all of our grocery shopping online.  Yesterday, my brother Mark asked if we could take care of his son Jason while he and his wife were out of town.  We agreed.  After all, it might be good to have another child in the house after all this time.  When Jason came home from school, he poored a glass of rich, smooth Tuscan whole milk and also decided that he wanted some cookies.  He climbed on top of the counter and, reaching for the cookie jar, slipped from the countertop.  The cookie jar full of Brian's ashes and the glass of milk both tumbled to the floor.  At the sound of the crash, Cindy and I rushed into the kitchen, and were astonished to see that the ashes were mixing with the milk to form the likeness of a human.  Over the course of several minutes, we watched in disbelief as our son was revived before our eyes.  I cannot describe to you the joy of having our son back.  But we don't know how to explain to our son what happened, or why he has a pool table in his room, or what mommy and daddy did with his college fund.",

What I found would change my life forever.If you look at the label, you'll see a city skyline with a cow jumping over the moon.  Many see this and assume it's just a logo.  But no, it's a version of their secret for how to extract this delicious milk.  The company actually owns a 82-story building which they take the cows to the roof to milk them.  The reasoning for the high price is because the cows can only be milked once.  You may ask yourself, why?  Here is where the secret comes in:  They attach an apparatus called Trimilkernator.  This apparatus attaches itself to the cow's nipples like a bungee cord and then when it's fully ready, the cow is pushed off the roof. The Trimilkernator is able to extract 4 gallons of milk before the cow hits the floor and splatters all over.  This is the real reason you see a cow 'flying' over a city as their logo. The rush of the cow falling to it's death adds a special flavor to the milk which is unmatched anywhere.Little known facts:- It can be used as a gas alternative.- It has been marked illegal by the NCAA, NBA, NFL, and MLS due to it's athletic enhancements (think steroids x 10).- You can find a bottle of it in many rap videos from 1995-2003.  Just look for it.- It has been known to give you photographic memory after 2 weeks of drinking at least 8oz each day.Hope this helps you guys make the choice and give this milk a try.",

Can't you get the news underground? Fourteen Galzik parasites straight into his brain. They never even knew I was on the ship. No, Ebbadon didn't hire me to do this. You never told me about her. You had an affair with Mariella. And when you were afraid she would tell me the truth, you... you killed her!\"\"No! No! I swear it!

I was acquiring this. One full gallon (128 fl oz) of Tuscan Whole Milk.\"Fear enveloped me. Every muscle in my body tensed up. I could feel my animal and human selves fighting for control. It was then that I blacked out.I awoke next to a pool of blood with scratches on my neck and buttocks that I can only guess must have come from me (Nakron, being a Cephalogicon has no nails or claws). Nakron was dead. There were many burnt holes in his torso and my gun was lodged deep in his soft Exo-skull.A Tuscan Whole Milk gallon container lay burst open; the contents mingling with Cephalogicon blood. I must have instinctually begun firing on Nakron as my animal self took over. Realizing my madness and that all hope was gone, Nakron must have decided to doom himself and the entire planet of Argosia by throwing the Tuscan Whole Milk at me. Fortunately for all of us (except Nakron of course) he had been given a dud. I guess I kept firing until I was out of Plasma Pellets at which point I bludgeoned him with my pistol until it got stuck. What I did next in my madness, I cannot begin to guess.Marveling over this, I tried to stand. I took a few drunken steps and dipped my small finger into the white pool that grew increasingly beige and Nakron's blood mixed into it. I touched my small finger to my tongue and fell over in relief.\"Dean's,\" I said to the dead Cephalogicon. \"They screwed you over and gave you Dean's you old spacedog you.\"",

In an attempt to move him up the ranks of paper pushers (pardon the pun), we decided to host a dinner party and invite some of his bosses.  Not being much of a homemaker, I was frantic to come up with a meal plan.  That is, until I discovered the response people seem to have to Tuscan Whole Milk.I ordered a gallon - 128 fluid ounces of pure dairy goodness.  I was quite concerned about how to serve Tuscan Whole Milk, because the packaging did not illustrate any \"Serving Suggestions\", like I'm used to seeing on cereal boxes, jello packets and soup cans.  Nor was there any peel-back label containing tasty recipes using Tuscan Whole Milk.  I was at a complete loss.  While I was pondering my next move, the doorbell rang.  I rushed to greet our guests and seat them in the dining room.  Then, under duress, I caught a glimmer of inspiration!  I ran back to the kitchen, kicking the Amazon box and air-bags out of the way, and stopped just short of the china cabinet.  The Riedel Crystal!  What better way to impress the upper crust than with Tuscan Whole Milk ensconced in the finest crystal wrought by Austrian artisans.  I plucked a handful of stems from the cabinet and popped the seal on Tuscan Whole Milk.  I was slightly overcome by the heady aromas unleashed from beneath the secure stay-fresh lid on Tuscan Whole Milk!  I couldn't believe the bouquet on this bovine libation - the sweet intoxicating blend of grass and grains, lovingly masticated and fermented into the supple, luxurious laiche that is Tuscan Whole Milk.Since time was of the essence, I didn't have the luxury of a full decanting of the Tuscan Whole Milk.  I had to place my family's financial stability and my husband's professional future in the capable hands of the fine dairy savants at Tuscan Products.  It was a gamble, to be sure, but we're talking about Tuscan Whole Milk, the flagship lactose au jus.  I poured with vigor and confidence.  The color was fantastic - it doesn't get any whiter than Tuscan Whole Milk.  I watched as the dulcet proteins coated the interior of the crystal and ran down to rejoin their lactose bretheren in the cradle of the stem.  Enough reverie: I've Tuscan Whole Milk to serve!I promenaded into the dining room, carefully toting my stems of Tuscan Whole Milk on my great-grandmother's silver serving tray.  I can imagine her in her own home, serving Tuscan Whole Milk to her esteemed guests.  With great hopes for the future of her own family, my ancestors, I believe my great-grandmother would've placed her trust in Tuscan Whole Milk back then.

Their \"Milk\" is just an attempt to cut into a market they don't understand based on brand name alone.First: The touch-screen was not all it's cracked up to be.  Sure, when I pressed hard enough, the \"open\" command got through, but to my mind a light touch should be all that is required.Second: No rust-proofing.  I live in an area where they salt the roads whether it's snowing or not, and so I expect to have a bit more rust on my car brakes than usual.  But this Milk rusted far beyond what I consider acceptable.  I may as well have bought orange juice.Third: There is no warning that this product must be separated by at least one padlock from \"Peanut Butter,\" especially when there is Ambien in the vicinity.  I'm strongly considering looking into this claim with, at least, the BBS, and at most calling an attourney - had I known, I would have kept a closer watch on the girlfriend.  As it is, I need to recoup the emergency stomach-pumping costs, or I'm out rent next month.Fourth And Last: Although another reviewer has already mentioned this, I want to reiterate the lack of customer support/service.  Not only are they unhelpful and rude, but when I kept my temper enough to enquire further, I realized that the number provided actually connects the customer with the Russian Embassy in Trinidad/Tobago.  Such a practical joke may be entertaining in theory, but this is just irresponsible.I don't get it.  As far as this consumer is concerned, the Tuscan brand name is a brand to trust - we're talking on par with Volvo, Samsung, and UAC.  They should have at least hired the right consultants before this adventeruous venture - but apparently not.Although, as one caveat, I've got to admit that my loyalty to Tuscan cheese, peppers, raiders, and hand cleansers remains firm.

I know some may find the comparison crude but ask a mother what her baby is like after she has eaten a few heads of garlic.  Not fun.  We understand that if you feed the cow sweet grass, sweet alfalfa, sweet corn etc. you will get a sweeter milk.  There was a time here in Europe when milk was very much a gourmet thing. People would simply buy their milk from a different farmer because it \"tasted better\".  That being so, farmers would compete for the taste of their customers.  You know how people are, they will try to be the best at anything.  So, like a farmer preparing his best goods for the State Fair, some farmers would feed their cows the best that they could.  Think of a bee keeper releasing his bees on to a field of clover or apple blossoms.  What could the dairyman do?  Let his cows eat from the same weed infested grass that they just pooped in?  Or could he bring them the leftovers from the fields, fruits, berries and herbs?  By doing so a farmer could turn out a truly great milk that was crisp, clean and delightfully sweet taste.  Unfortunately, Tuscan taste like regular milk.",

    "body": "I would like to tell a story about how I came across this Tuscan Whole Milk and why I only rate it as a three star product.It began while I was fixing the horizontal stabilizer on my Marske Monarch. I was gliding over the Cape of Good Hope when I found a peculiar village. I decided this would be a fine location to land in order to see if anyone was in need of my free medical services. As I was adjusting the rudder and elevator to land on a thin dirt strip, I miscalculated adjustments and found myself barreling into dry grass field just shy of the strip. My co-pilot, Mr. Lucas, a mute servant I employ over the summer seasons, shook me until I woke. We gathered the parts that detached themselves from the glider upon the crash landing, and began reassembling the plane. To my surprise, a group of tribal men walked up to us and made gestures for us to follow them into the village. I instructed Mr. Lucas to gather my scuba equipment, medical pouch, GPS system, the satellite phone, and Forest Invader (a small parlor monkey I purchased in Bangalore) and we followed the strange men into the village. This apparently was all just a trick, as we were thrown into nets and into the back of a gray Datsun, which had seen better days. By my judgment of distance, they drove us 10-15 miles north. They stopped the truck and Mr. Lucas and myself were thrown out onto a paved road. The angry tribal men sped away, yelling God knows what in some strange, ancient language. Not 20 minutes into walking north up the road, we were picked up by a caravan headed to Cairo. I say! The first good bit news the entire day. They were glad to haul us (and my equipement and pet) along to Egypt. We arrived in Egypt some days later, on the almost exact opposite side of the very continent I crashed landed on earlier. It is in Cairo where I would make arrangements that led me try Tuscan Whole Milk.Mr. Lucas and I found our way to the Semiramis Intercontinental where I purchased a 2 room suite. We dropped off our equipment and headed to the hotel bar. On my 2nd glass of brandy, a man by the name of Mr. Grove (the only name he gave) approached me and casually asked if I would be interested in a business deal. Of course, I asked what of, and, I say! Mr. Grove needed to move 20 crates of Tuscan Whole Milk, which were in a refrigerated truck outside of the hotel! He offered 1000USD up front for the delivery of the boxes to his warehouse in South Africa (how strange are the hands that life deals) and 1000USD on the safe return of the truck to Cairo. Of course, I had 2 things on my mind at this time: retrieving my crashed Monarch from that blasted village and getting off of this continent. I accepted immediately, and used part of the payment to buy a trailer to haul back my glider to an airport in Cairo (you see, you need an engine aircraft to get the glider in the air). Mr. Lucas and I reached South Africa in a few days. The destination was Johannesburg, and by chance was only a 3 hour drive from my plane. While winding through the streets of Johannesburg, we were stopped by the South African Police Service, who demanded to examine the contents of the refrigerated truck. I have never known their men to be schooled in corruption, but the next thing I knew, Mr. Lucas and myself were in handcuffs and short 19 crates of Whole Milk. Of course, I bribed them a few Rand for our release and we were on our way. There was no way the warehouse would accept the shipment now, so I used the remaining payment to hire a translator while I was in the city, and floored the gas all the way to the village and its tribe.Upon arrival, I instructed the translator to demand their leader turn over my beloved Monarch or we would be forced to contact authorities (good Mr. Lucas was ready to dial away at the satellite phone). A strange exchange went on between the translator and the elder. A few moments later I was told they would barter for it. Of course, I offered the contents of the truck (save for Forest Invader). The elder opened the doors of the truck and took out a gallon of the milk in order to see if the ivory nectar was to his liking. He immediately spit it out! He yelled some sort of ancient orders to a group of men standing next to the truck, and a few seconds later, a sea of torches flowed towards the field where my bird was perched! I knew what ill fate my glider would meet in the coming minutes. The tribe bagged us yet again, but this time we were dropped off at a different location... the burned wreckage of my glider. After the tribe drove away, Mr. Lucas chewed his way out of the netting and freed myself and the translator. After a few minutes of argument with the translator, I awarded him the truck as an apology for this mess, and he drove off out of sight.There I was, a pilgrim in an unholy land, weeping in the ashes of my once cherished Monarch, with only my satellite phone, Forest Invader, and Mr. Lucas by my side, trying desperately to enjoy the remaining gallon of Tuscan Whole milk the tribe left for us (for they burned the rest of the crate), but I could not muster even a grin, as the cruel odor of burning fiberglass forced me to cast a frown. This opaline swill in my hand was the true cause of my grief, and I could not force myself to fully take pleasure in what remained. I gave the remaining carton of milk to my faithful servant, who seemed to enjoy it enough. He gulped down what remained and quickly displayed the thumbs up, which, in his odd mute ways, was a sign of appreciation. I'm glad you enjoyed the Tuscan liquid, Mr. Lucas, because I certainly did not.And now I hope you can see why I only afforded this whole milk 3 stars. I lost my glider, my scuba gear, my medical pouch, a small part of my sanity, and over a week of my life because Tuscan Whole Milk did not live up to the standards of some crude tribesman of yesteryear. I still mourn about the event to this day, while Forest Invader gently weeps beside me.",

It's texas holdem, low carbs, and reality TV all rolled into one. But this is one fad that is sure to last.I bought my first gallon, and not being one for moderation, I ended up drinking the whole gallon one morning. I was just going to drink a glass before work, then be on my way. One glass turned into two. Two turned into a bigger glass. Next thing I know I was sprawled out on my living room floor next to the empty gallon.I stumbled up and made my way out the door, only to arrive at work and meet an angry boss. He said he was letting me go, and I was \"no longer a part of the vision\". I was angry. And very much dissapointed. I loaded my things into my car and drove away.On the way home, my car started sputtering. All the lights came on, and my engine fell out while going down the freeway. I pulled to the side of the road, and started walking. I certainly wasn't going to call a tow truck, I can't afford it now.I then got the bright idea to call my girlfriend. Upon answering, I could hear a man's voice in the background. She was out of breath, and certainly had just come back from a long jog. I asked if she would come and pick me up, and she said she was \"indisposed at the moment\". I then became more angry, and asked her why not. She promptly dumped me.With my belly still full of Tuscan Milk, I plodded on towards my home. I started pondering why she was leaving me, and entertained the thought that it must have something to do with that man in the background. Who was he? Why was he there? Then it dawned on me. The truth, as I had then thought, had arrived.It's that damn tuscan milk! I foolishly blamed the milk for my problems. I lost my job, my car broke, and my girlfriend left me. All in one morning! I thought the milk was the cause.Hours later, I arrived at my home. \"Nice\" I thought, as I spotted the 30 day notice. The thought of now getting kicked out my house kind of made me smile. At this point, nothing could get worse, right?

This whole situation will be erased. With my millions, everything will change.Fired from my job? Now I don't need one.Car broke down? I'll buy a lexus instead.Kicked out my house? To heck with renting, I'll buy a new one.Family dead? I'll buy a new one.Girlfriend left?  You get the picture.All my problems are solved!A few days ago I recieved an email from the prince of Nigeria. I appears their government is collapsing. And they need to move 100 million dollars out of there, STAT. So they researched, searching the world for a top secret, financial mercernary to give the money to, and found me. They must have heard about my skills. So they contacted me. I get, as a commission, ten percent of the take. If you think about it, that's a pretty good deal for someone who is saving your country.I've given them the neccessary banking information to the proper agents, and everything should be transferring soon. I will hang out in the park, where I now live, and wait for that phone call. Once I recieve the phone call, the money went through, and you are looking at a ten millionaire. I think I'll go purchase some new duds, and maybe head down to vegas and bet ten thousand a hand. I'll fly to miami and dig my toes in the sand, or jet off to Hawaii for some fun in the sun.I'm here at the library surfing amazon, and wanted to order some milk. For some reason my ATM wouldn't go through, kept saying insufficient funds, even though there is money in there. Must be some mistake.

The Italian meer cat, or \"stupidi americani bevono sperma roditori\" in Latin is roughly translated as \"very impressive milk product\". The government of this third world country is so proud of their Tuscan Whole Milk that they are willing to share this rare and precious commodity with the western world for only $ 45 USD (+15 million Florin shipping and handling).This very impressive milk product can be used for anything from helping to fortify the sexual potency of the Alaskan female logging community to improving your over-all bone density and strength, which is as the name of this review implies, is what I use it for. The Italian Meer cat is highly prized in Canada for its therapeutic powers when ground down into an oil and rubbed vigorously into the scalp. The citizens of America's Hat use this homeopathic treatment to grow hair on their notoriously bald heads. As Im sure you know Canadian's are world renown for their male pattern baldness that even happens to their woman. However what is lesser known about the Canadians is that if you've ever met a citizen of the great frozen north that had any hair on their bodies at all, it was due entirely to the glandular secretions of the Italian Meer Cat. Italian Meer Cat milking can often be so violent that the World Trade Organization has passed international laws barring Canadians from owning, breeding or otherwise trading openly the Italian Meer Cat fluids. Before the creation of this law, Canadians selfish obsession with the Stupidi Americani Bevono nearly drove this beloved Italian rodent into total extinction.Thankfully our brave American armed forces stepped in to protect and guarantee the survival of this regal animal in a conflict which is now known as \"Gulf War 1\". Having disposed the vile dictator Ley Fagi Kaklvor (or some such Canadian nonsense) our Boys in Arms extinguished the swelling communism in their flaccid socialist hearts insuring once and for all the plorification this tiny nation's only export.In conclusion, Tuscan Whole milk tastes as good as its name sounds and is well worth the $ 45 USD (+15 million Florin shipping and handling) to import this wonderful and most impressive milk product directly to your door.Travis the Impalor, Amazon Product reviewer.(PS: Also makes an impressive skin treatment for the migrant children I keep imprisoned in a well.

I went by an insane machine and then by a crazy fountain, and got to the store, and purchased my goods, only to realize that I forgot where I was.  I asked advice of a strange technicolor man, who sent me on my way ... having reminded me of all the bizarre landmarks I passed.  So I got home and exclaimed to my mother look, I remembered!

They had marked my mother for death, as she had seen one of them unmasked in a secret murder spree in the park.

Martin Brodeur was actually the masked leader, who has been assassinating kittens and mothers for the last 15 years, by making ninja stars out of the Vezina trophy.

    "body": "I come here today to warn you about Tuscan Milk.I was friends with Tuscan Milk (aka - TM) for a long time and I'll always remember the good times - Frisbee golf in the park, picking up chicks in the 7-11 parking lot and watching horror movies were our favorite activities.As we passed through our late teens and went to college, TM took off on a different path that would change our lives forever. I remember TM coming into class, eyes the size of pin points, sweating profusely and feverishly scratching his handle. TM started wearing long sleeve shirts, even in the middle of the summer and my friends and I, somewhat bewildered, became increasingly concerned.Then one day, TM disappeared. Strangely, my car stereo, turntables and VCR were gone as well. We tried calling TM's cell phone, it was shut off. We tried TM's parents' house, they hadn't seen him either.Noone heard from or saw TM for a year and a half until one day, my roommate Rinaldo paged me with '911' and I had a feeling I knew what it was about. I called Rinaldo and he excitedly told me about how he saw TM just a few miles away from our house and he was going to pick me up momentarily. I jumped in the car and Rinaldo turned off his stereo which had been pumping 'Pure Ecstasy - Trance Hits Volume 3' and then I knew things were serious. He loved that CD.We descended the hill leading from our house to downtown and took a right turn into what was widely known as a very rough area rife with gangs, drug sales, prostitution and violent crime. I asked Rinaldo where we were going and he just looked at me, stone faced, and kept driving.We made a left onto 15th street and gradually came to a stop. Rinaldo glanced over at me, then out his window and then I saw him. TM, leaning on a grocery cart full of bags of aluminum cans, his cap halfway off and label faded and torn, looking absolutely beat to death.Rinaldo and I jumped out of the car and ran over to TM, who stared at us blankly and stood from leaning on the cart.\"Five dollars.\", TM said. \"Anything you want for five dollars.\"Rinaldo and I looked at each other, confused, then focused back on TM. I reached in my pocket and pulled our five dollars, handing it to him.\"A'ight. Come with me.\", TM said.Rinaldo and I looked at each other and shrugged, then followed TM. He lead us down an alley way, where he looked over his shoulder at us, then leaned forward, his cap off, onto a dumpster. Rinaldo and I knew at that moment what things had come to for TM. He glared us while we stood there, shocked, and said \"What? You not ready yet? Fine. I'll be right back.\"TM replaced his cap and walked around the corner. Moments later we heard a ruckus following by the sound of a slight spill and we knew what had happened. Rinaldo and I waited a few minutes before walking around the corner, only to find TM lying on the ground, a 1/4 of the way spilled on the pavement, with a very small manilla envelope with 'NBA' stamped on it lying next to him.We loaded TM into Rinaldo's car and took him to the Emergency Room where we waited for what seemed like days. Eventually, a doctor emerged from behind the ER doors only to tell us that TM, after struggling with a nurse, took off out the back door of the hospital.That was the last time we saw TM.Rinaldo and I arrived at home and decided to look TM up on our city's criminal offender database and were shocked at what we found. TM had been arrested over 3 dozen times in the last year and a half for everything ranging from drug possession, robbery, kidnapping and forgery to what shocked us the most - aggrivated sexual assault (see the customer images section for proof).We looked at court documents for several of TM's cases and found that most of the time he was arrested after being found slumped against a building or in an alley, a needle sticking out of his handle, heavily under the influence of heroin.It all made sense now. The eyes, the sweating, the scratching... the prostitution. It was clear at that point that TM would never be the jolly gallon of milk we once loved and cherished as a trusted and valued friend.Upon finding TM here on Amazon, I felt it was necessary to warn you that TM is a dangerous, unpredictable individual who, as is clearly evident, is more than willing to sell himself...likely to support his heroin habit.Rinaldo, myself and the rest of TM's old friends still care about him and don't want to hear about him on the news - overdosed or violently killed - so I ask you - please do not purchase Tuscan Milk. You are contributing to furthering the downfall of someone who was once a friendly, optimistic, bright white gallon of goodness.. but has since become a monster and threat to others and himself.Don't buy Tuscan Milk.

One thinks of the numerous and continuing attempts to render Dante's \"Divina Commedia\" (another early vernacular Italian masterpiece and contemporary to the justifiably obscure Tuscana Latte series) and the struggle with both terza rima and meaning. No so for Tuscan Whole Milk (\"La tutta latte\"). Few works are better left where they were found, their authors condemned and eventually flogged. This translation of the redredged third valume of the series was committed by Sir John Stilton, the inebriated English librettist for two of the earliest publicly-immolated operas by P.D.Q Bach, themselves loosely based, in part, on the Tuscan series and \"Mechanicae Popularum\": \"Die Fliegende Kuhe\" and \"Das Zaubereuter\", both banned before their opening nights sometime in the early 1760s.That Stilton translated the Tuscan series at all was no mere stroke of misfortune. He was a cousin of Leopold von Emmenthaler, present at the Great Flushing of the Florentine sewers in 1755. As recounted in his memoir \"Besottene Reisen\", returning to his rooms late one night from a drinking binge, Leopold fell into an open ditch which drained into the Arno, but had been clogged. He was saved from drowning in the filth by the floating obstruction created by a massive snarl of wig hair and old used manuscripts -- part of which would later be tragically identified as the only complete copy of \"Tuscan.\" Inspired to further drink by the experience, Leopold vowed to champion the mysterious work. He passed it to Stilton in a stupor sometime in 1759. Though arrested, Leopold was never proscuted for the act and he fled to his native Limburg.Rarely misunderstood and best left un-retold, \"Whole Milk\" is the culminating volume of the Tuscan series, but can be read (if necessary) as a standalone work, as both Skim (\"Scremato\" or \"Senza Grassi\") and Two-Percent (\"Cauto\") are diatribes on celibacy and vegetables respectively.  A tale of love, betrayal, and gastrointestinal distress, it is in this infamous portion of the \"work\" that Contessa Bessi meets the cowherd Giovanni de Sargento (the cloaked \"Count Grasso\") and confronts him with the immortal question \"Gotta de latte?\" This dubiuosly romantic passage is considered by some scholars as the inspiration for later poetry (e.g. Wordsworth's \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cow\" (1804); Dickinson's \"#255\", (\"\"Cow\" is the thing with horns.\" (1867)), books (\"Care of Dairy Cattle in Central Peru\" (1843); Proust's \"Du Cafe chez Vache\" (1914)), and even movies (among them \"Cud\" (1963) with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal; \"El Cud,\" (1961) with Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren; and \"The Guns of Navorone\" (1961) with Gregorgy Peck and Anthony Quinn).This Stilton translation of Tuscan Whole Milk remains one of the more curdling, if only because he manages to improve the flavor of the work to the point that more innocent readers might be unwittingly exposed to it. It is clear that Stilton spoke little Italian, certainly not the 14th century vernacular of the region, and had no concept of style and structure. It is not certain that he was even completely literate in English.One star for calcium.",

When my Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz arrived by mail I was ecstatic.The packaging was flawless, I noted that nothing had spilled en route. However, I was concerned that the jug-like design would make it difficult to apply this runny product to my locks. I did mitigate this by mixing the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz with some shea butter and left over Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler.As expected, the mixture went into my roots a little white, so I sat under the dryer to allow it to set into my curls.

I won the junior UFC nano weight division title after drinking 5 gallons of Tuscan whole milk (though nearly did get disqualified because of the weight gain, a quick wet burp before the weigh in took care of that).Emboldened after the fight, with a Tuscan 1 gallon milk jug in hand, I headed out to the Vegas clubs and bumped (and burped) into Megan Fox. I'd like to think that I have massive python biceps and I tucked her up against my chest (sort of like those romance novel covers)...but really my scrawny arms barely blocked the martini glass she hurled in my direction. Then her twin beefy body guards grabbed my shoulders with their pinkies (ouch!) and much to my surprise instead of being pummeled flat into the ground (nodding towards the Tuscan milk jug) they casually spun me around and slipped me into Megan's embrace.Needless to say my stomach did a flip flop and up chucked a Tuscan cheese ball that landed dead center in her cleavage. Instead of the anticipated crotchgrabandtwist move she plucked the aforementioned cheese ball from her decolletage and plopped into her mouth. Her eyes (they're pretty big to begin with) exploded with delight, she grabbed me by the collars, wedging the Tuscan milk jug between us and proceeded to lambada me to her limo.Well, needless to say a private \"party\" ensued at her secluded Vegas residence. Thank goodness for Tuscan milk - it kept the mojo going on. Now two years later, I'm still going strong. Yeah, I'm locked up in Megan's Vegas condo, have to do the whole milkman thing, but hey - I'm not complaining - I get to hold her milk jugs every morning. Thanks Tuscan Whole Milk!",

    "body": "The Engagement - by Gabriel BotnickJonas stood there befuddled.  He stared at a wall of white, speckled with patches of blue, green, pink, and red.  The light emitted from the wall was nearly blinding.  The chill penetrated deep into his bones.  Anxiety draped his entire body like this blanket of cold which he was beginning to resent.\"May I help you find something?\" asked a clerk in Dickies, which were hidden underneath his bright red apron.\"No thank you.  I'm just looking,\" responded Jonas, hesitant to admit his inability to decide.  \"Actually, yes...I would love your advice,\" he continued.  \"I have found the perfect woman and I've decided to make her my bride.  Can you help me?\"The clerk proceeded to introduce himself to Jonas.  His name was Dean Minor.  He was an older man and he sported a thick black mustache like a badge of honor.  This mustache stood in stark contrast to his graying hair, which looked quite disheveled today.  He extended his right hand to Jonas.  His hand looked like it had been relegated to a life of manual labor.  The palms were hardened over with calluses and his fingers looked like they were carved from sandstone.Jonas accepted his hand with a subtle smile.  He was well-aware that wisdom came with age and hard work.  Jonas had spent his nearly-thirty years in the world without a father.  This man, he knew, would temporarily fill that role by offering his wisdom and advice.\"You've come to the right place,\" Dean assured.  \"We have a large selection here at Tuscan.  If you can't find it here, you can't find it nowhere.\"Jonas released some tension with a deep breath.  \"Samantha...that's her name, Samantha...well, she keeps dropping hints to me.  She leaves magazines open on the coffee table.  She boasts about her friends' jugs.  Hell...they even compare jugs at parties.\"My buddies even try to help me out with advice.  Steve, my best friend...he tried teaching me the terms.  He told me about skim, low-fat, and whole.  Pints, half-gallons, gallons.  He even knows a guy who went to Costco and bought a double-gallon.\"\"Don't forget pasteurized and fortified,\" Dean offered with a laugh.  He knew the options were daunting and his kind voice would calm Jonas' nerves.Dean reached out to the wall and grabbed a half-gallon of whole milk.\"You see, Jonas, size doesn't really matter.  It's all about what fits Samantha's style.  Some women need to have a full gallon even if it goes to waste.  They just need to know that it's all there.  Other women are a bit more modest and perfectly happy with a half.  I'd steer you away from the pints, though.  Sooner or later, you'll just have to go out and get another.\"Jonas appreciated this advice.  Here was an expert who had helped many other men pick out the perfect jug of milk.  Jonas knew he would make the right decision.\"Now what about skim versus whole?  What do you think's best?\"\"It all depends on how you look at life, Jonas.  Some people are a bit more timid and prefer skim.  Others are go-getters and won't stop and anything short of the real deal...they prefer whole.\"In my opinion,\" he continued, \"I always like to go with a nice low-fat option.  Two percent is perfect.  It's the right balance in quality.\"Jonas agreed that this all made sense.  Though there was still one question running through his mind.  Earlier in the summer, he and Samantha were sitting around watching the news when they were shocked by a commercial for soy milk.  Was this true?  Is there really a synthetic milk that's just a good as the real thing?  Jonas knew he had to ask.\"Dean...what can you tell me about this soy milk?\"\"Oh, it's not just soy these days.  There's also almond and rice milk.  Sure, the ads claim they taste just like the real thing, but don't be fooled.  There's no substitute for good, ol' fashion milk.\"Dean proceeded to show Jonas all his options.  He explained the difference between different dairies and why some milk costs more than others.  After a few, brief minutes, Jonas settled on a gallon of Tuscan whole milk.Jonas walked out of the grocery with a smile of satisfaction.  He spent the perfect amount on Samantha.  Sure, three ninety-nine was a lot to pay for milk.  Sure, he could have settled for an off-brand or a smaller size.  None of this mattered, though.  Samantha deserved the best.Jonas showed up at Samantha's apartment in no unique fashion.  Every Thursday, after work, Jonas would come over for the evening.  The two lovers would grab a bite to eat and then return home to watch their favorite tv shows.This night was different, though.  Samantha didn't know that Jonas left work an hour early.  He still managed to buzz her front door at six-fifteen...just as always.  She also didn't know that he spent the entire week deciding on the perfect restaurant and meal.  He wanted to make sure that wherever they went - whatever they ate - would go perfectly with a glass of milk.Jonas contemplated various cuisines.  Would steak go with milk?  How about fish?  He finally settled on their favorite Indian restaurant, Lotus Blossom.  Jonas remembered all the creamy dishes they had enjoyed in the past.  He thought the milk would be the perfect drink to cut the spice of the food.  He called the restaurant on his lunch break and reserved a quiet table in the back, making sure he could drop off the milk in advance.Samantha walked through the restaurant doors and immediately knew something was awry.  Instead of being ignored by the employees - which she learned to accept in favor of the delicious food - she was greeted with a big smile and warm hello.The owner turned to Jonas a said, \"Welcome back, Mr. Hood.  Will it just be the two of you tonight?\"Samantha raised an eyebrow and flashed Jonas a look of unease.  Were they being filmed?  Had they stepped into an alternate universe?  Jonas shrugged and told her not to worry.  However, when they were lead past their usual cramped table up front for a large, private, round table in the back, Samantha demanded to know what was going on.\"Something really special happened today,\" was all the explanation Jonas offered.  Samantha smiled and kindly accepted the seat being offered to her by her boyfriend.  She sat there watching his graceful form take its place opposite her.  Jonas looked up from the napkin he was neatly placing across his lap and smiled at the woman he loved.  At this moment, Samantha knew why she loved Jonas.  It was not because of his athletic build or the way he looked in his business suit.  It was not the way his blonde, wavy hair dangled past his brow and playfully teased his lashes behind his frameless glasses.  It wasn't even the way he spoke to the people around them - with an ease reminiscent of childhood friends returning home for the holidays.  She knew she loved him because of the kindness in his eyes, the way he always looked out for her while respecting her ability, and the knowledge that he'd always be there for her.Anxious to find out the good news, Samantha blurted out, \"So tell me already.  What are we celebrating?  What happened today?\"Jonas smiled at this quasi interrogation.  He loved her inability to hide what she's thinking.  He always knew what was on her mind because she always blurted it out in short sentences.\"We're celebrating the fact that I love you.\"\"Is that it?  I already knew that.  But what happened today?\"\"What happened today is that I realized I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.\"With these words, Jonas reached underneath the table and pulled out the gallon of milk from a cooler the owner had set there not even an hour earlier.He continued - \"Samantha, will you marry me?\" - and offered her the jug of milk.\"Oh...I...ah...Jonas, of course I'll marry you!\"Samantha was thrilled by the questioned and overjoyed with the milk.

I went to Walmart to buy a couple bottle of Advil so thati could finally end my suffering....But something was calling out to me.. something specifically in the dairy aisle.It seemed as if no one heard the hymn except me.. I followed the beautiful sound...It was.. Tuscan Whole Milk.. It wasn't any generic brand or Farm O Land brand of milk..But this brand in particular.I opened the door slowly.. and grab the bottle by his handleHe was a bit heavy.. but I don't judgeWe needed more privacy so we go to the bathroom, the handicap stall since it's a lot biggerI get on my knees and slowly start working on the knob of him..I rip off his head and start drink the white aphrodisiacs liquid slowly pouring out of him .I was in a higher state of euphoria... I took off my fedora and tied my hair back.And started slowly licking the outer edges of the head, he was pushing back and forth, andgot some of his white love juice into my mouth and eyes...It wasn't until later.. he started slowly go down on me, and poured his love mayonnaise all over.Our fun lasted about 20 minutes, until a fellow consumer called a janitor to come clean up the mess and hefound me and my lover on the floor in a puddle of our love juices.My life has never been better and I am no longer suicidal.But I am on probation for public indecency  and theft.. but it was worth it.Appreciate your local milk. It will help you when you're in a low of your life.also I gave a 4 star rating and not 5 because, I shouldn't have been arrested.",

  {
    "body": "One should not be intimidated by Tuscan Whole Milk. Nor should one prejudge, despite the fact that Tuscan is non-vintage and comes in such large containers. Do not be fooled: this is not a jug milk. I always find it important to taste milk using high-quality stemware -- this is milk deserving of something better than a Flintstones plastic tumbler.  One should pour just a small dollop and swirl it in the glass -- note the coating and look for clots or discoloration. And the color -- it should be opaque, and very, very white. Now, immerse your nose in the glass and take a whiff. Tuscan transports you instantly to scenic hill towns in central Italy (is that Montepulciano I detect?) --- there is the loamy clay, the green grass of summer days, the towering cypress.  And those gentle hints of Italian flowers -- wild orchids, sunflowers, poppies. Then, one takes in the thick liquid and lets it roll across and under the tongue -- what is that? perhaps a hint of a nutty Edam cheese?  With Tuscan, you feel the love of every dairyperson involved -- from the somewhat sad and deranged farmhand shovelling steaming cowpies to the bored union milk maiden dreaming of leaving this soul crushing life behind for a job waiting tables for obnoxious American tourists in Siena.  But not too fast -- sip gently, slowly, or one is in danger of not only missing the subtleties of the milk's texture and its terroir, but -- if chilled too long -- also of giving oneself a blinding ice cream headache. Nay, savor the goodness that only dairymen and dairywomen working at the apex of their craft can deliver. Tuscan is best drunk young -- no, no, don't cellar this gem -- I guarantee you'll be sorry if you do.  I recommend pairing with freshly baked macadamia nut scones.
